Neutral aetherborn might devote much of their time (and wealth) to parties and social activity, while evil aetherborn are usually involved in the criminal underworld.\n\n\n### Size\n\n\nAetherborn are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. They are quite light—only about 100 pounds—and their weight diminishes as they age and more and more of their substance returns to the aethersphere. Your size is Medium.\n\n\n### Darkvision\n\n\nThanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n\n### Born of Aether\n\n\nYou have resistance to necrotic damage.\n\n\n### Menacing\n\n\nYou have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\n\n\n### Languages\n\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.\n\nAn unknown aetherborn, desperately seeking a means to extend their short life, discovered a process of transformation that prolonged their existence—by giving them the ability to feed on the life essence of other beings. Since then, other aetherborn have learned and carried out this monstrous transformation, and aetherborn with this \"gift\" have become a small minority among an already small population.\n\nA gifted aetherborn has the ability to drain the life essence of other beings. Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.\n\nFor many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of \"want\" and \"need\" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.\n\nAt the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark \"gift.\" The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see \"\" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.\n\nAn aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals 1d6 necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest."

Once a hexblood undergoes this irreversible ritual, they emerge as a hag NPC no longer under the control of the hexblood's player, unless the DM rules otherwise."

Your size is Medium.\n\n\n### Swim Speed\n\n\nYou have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n### Bite\n\n\nYour fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\n\n### Cunning Artisan\n\n\nAs part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 dart or blowgun needle. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan's tools, such as leatherworker's tools.\n\n\n### Hold Breath\n\n\nYou can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.\n\n\n### Hunter's Lore\n\n\nYou gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.\n\n\n### Natural Armor\n\n\nYou have tough, scaly skin.

A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.\n\n\n### Hungry Jaws\n\n\nIn battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you can't use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n\n### Languages\n\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic."

A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.\n\nWhen the game gives you more than one way to calculate your Armor Class, you can use only one of them. You choose the one to use. For example, if you have the loxodon's Natural Armor trait and the monk's Unarmored Defense feature, you don't mix them together. Instead, you choose which one determines your AC.\n\n\n### Trunk\n\n\nYou can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.\n\nYour trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.\n\n\n### Keen Smell\n\n\nThanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.\n\n\n### Languages\n\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Common and Loxodon."

A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.\n\n\n### Size\n\n\nTortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.\n\n\n### Claws\n\n\nYour claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\n\n### Hold Breath\n\n\nYou can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.\n\n\n### Natural Armor\n\n\nDue to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.\n\n\n### Shell Defense\n\n\nYou can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.\n\n\n### Survival Instinct\n\n\nYou gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.\n\n\n### Languages\n\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common."

Most vampires are thus very old, but few have any memory of their earliest years.\n\n\n### Alignment\n\n\nVampires have no innate tendency toward evil, but consuming the life energy of other creatures often pushes them to that end. Regardless of their moral bent, the strict hierarchies of their bloodchiefs inclines them toward a lawful alignment.\n\n\n### Size\n\n\nVampires are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.\n\n\n### Blood Thirst\n\n\nYou can drain blood and life energy from a willing creature, or one that is grappled by you, incapacitated, or restrained. Make a melee attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and 1d6 necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n\n\n### Darkvision\n\n\nThanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
