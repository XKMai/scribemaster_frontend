You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.\n2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.\n3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.\n4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.\n5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.\n6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.\n7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.\n8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)\n2 | Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)\n3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)\n4 | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)\n5 | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)\n6 | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.\n2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.\n3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.\n4 | Everything I do is for the common people.\n5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.\n6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.\n2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.\n3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.\n4 | I am inflexible in my thinking.\n5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.\n6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.",

You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs and customs Choose a race whose culture you've adopted, or roll on the Adopted Culture table.\n\nd8 | Culture\n--- | ---\n1 | Aarakocra\n2 | Dwarf\n3 | Elf\n4 | Goblin\n5 | Halfling\n6 | Human\n7 | Lizardfolk\n8 | Orc\n\n\n### Feature: Adept Linguist\n\n\nYou can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures - enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nAnthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life is like in other parts of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive - or why they did not. Some anthropologists are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire's downfall.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I prefer the company of those who aren't like me, including people of other races\n2 | I'm a stickler when it comes to observing proper etiquette and local customs\n3 | I would rather observe than meddle\n4 | By living among violent people, I have become desensitized to violence.\n5 | I would risk life and limb to discover a new culture or unravel the secrets of a dead one.\n6 | When I arrive at a new settlement for the first time, I must learn all its customs.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Discovery. I want to be the first person to discover a lost culture. (Any)\n2 | Distance. One must not interfere with the affairs of another culture - even one in need of aid. (Lawful)\n3 | Knowledge. By understanding other races and cultures, we learn to understand ourselves. (Any)\n4 | Power. Common people crave strong leadership, and I do my utmost to provide it. (Lawful)\n5 | Protection. I must do everything possible to save a society facing extinction. (Good)\n6 | Indifferent. Life is cruel. What's the point in saving people if they're going to die anyway? (Chaotic)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My mentor gave me a journal filled with lore and wisdom. Losing it would devastate me.\n2 | Having lived among the people of a primeval tribe or clan, I long to return and see how they are faring.\n3 | Years ago, tragedy struck the members of an isolated society I befriended, and I will honor them.\n4 | I want to learn more about a particular humanoid culture that fascinates me.\n5 | I seek to avenge a clan, tribe, kingdom, or empire that was wiped out.\n6 | I have a trinket that I believe is the key to finding a long-lost society.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | Boats make me seasick.\n2 | I talk to myself, and I don't make friends easily.\n3 | I believe that I'm intellectually superior to people from other cultures and have much to teach them.\n4 | I've picked up some unpleasant habits living among goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs.\n5 | I complain about everything.\n6 | I wear a tribal mask and never take it off.",

Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands.

Idiots who trigger traps make me nervous.\n7 | I might fail, but I will never give up.\n8 | You might think I'm a scholar, but I love a good brawl. These fists were made for punching.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Preservation. That artifact belongs in a museum. (Good)\n2 | Greed. I won't risk my life for nothing. I expect some kind of payment. (Any)\n3 | Death Wish. Nothing is more exhilarating than a narrow escape from the jaws of death. (Chaotic)\n4 | Dignity. The dead and their belongings deserve to be treated with respect. (Lawful)\n5 | Immortality. All of my exploring is part of a plan to find the secret of everlasting life. (Any)\n6 | Danger. With every great discovery comes grave danger. The two walk hand in hand. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | Ever since I was a child, I've heard stories about a lost city. I aim to find it, learn its secrets, and earn my place in the history books.\n2 | I want to find my mentor, who disappeared on an expedition some time ago.\n3 | I have a friendly rival. Only one of us can be the best, and I aim to prove it's me.\n4 | I won't sell an art object or other treasure that has historical significance or is one of a kind.\n5 | I'm secretly in love with the wealthy patron who sponsors my archaeological exploits.\n6 | I hope to bring prestige to a library, a museum, or a university.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have a secret fear of some common wild animal - and in my work, I see them everywhere.\n2 | I can't leave a room without searching it for secret doors.\n3 | When I'm not exploring dungeons or ruins. I get jittery and impatient.\n4 | I have no time for friends or family.

As an action, you channel minor magic involving the element of your chosen Ashari order, giving you one of the following abilities:\n\n\n### Pyrah\n\n\nYou instantaneously create and control a burst of flame small enough to light a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. Alternatively, you snuff out a flame of the same size.\n\n\n### Terrah\n\n\nYou instantaneously create a small rock no larger than a gold (gp). The rock appears in your hand, then turns to dust after 1 minute.\n\n\n### Vesrah\n\n\nYou instantaneously create enough hot or cold water to fill a small drinking vessel.\n\n\n### Zephrah\n\n\nYou create an instantaneous puff of wind strong enough to blow papers off a desk or mess up someone's hair.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe Ashari hold themselves removed from the rest of Tal'Dorei by their own choice. This makes many Ashari naive to the ways of the world beyond their homes—but it can also make them determined, steadfast, and tightly focused on their goals. Ever since Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest and leader of the Zephrah, became a world-renowned hero, the Air Ashari at least have become more familiar to Tal'Dorei's other peoples. They are known to welcome outsiders to their mountaintop enclave, and to take on quests that force them to leave their isolated home.\n\nTo learn more about your character's Ashari order, see \"The Ashari\".\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I like to keep my hands busy, no matter where I am.\n2 | I love to explore new places and meet new people.\n3 | I meditate at dawn each day—and I can't stand it when my routine is interrupted.\n4 | I like noticing patterns in the world around me, whether or not they mean anything.\n5 | I don't let anything—or anyone—stand in the way of my mission.\n6 | I'm a plain talker, even with people who outrank me.\n7 | I've always got some of my native element with me in some form.

It's important to surround yourself with people you can count on, and who will support you. (Good)\n3 | Knowledge. I want to learn everything I can about the Elemental Planes—and maybe even visit them myself. (Neutral)\n4 | Freedom. I don't care what anyone says. Even if it causes problems, the elements must be free. And so should I. (Chaotic)\n5 | Structure. The elements are in harmony when they are free to act as they will, within the safe boundaries set by the Ashari. People are much the same. (Lawful)\n6 | Virtuous Cycle.

When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where you grew up, there is a 50 chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter.\n\nBetween adventures, you might compete in athletic events sufficient enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, as per the \"Practicing a Profession\" downtime activity in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.\n\n\n### Favored Event\n\n\nWhile many athletes practice various games and events, most excel at a single form of competition.

People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.\n\n\n### Azorius Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Azorius Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | friends, message\n1st | command, ensnaring strike\n2nd | arcane lock, calm emotions, hold person\n3rd | clairvoyance, counterspell\n4th | compulsion, divination\n5th | dominate person\n\nYour magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes floating and glowing in the air in circular patterns or of shimmering azure barriers of magical energy. If you cast ensnaring strike, for example, the vines created by the spell might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target and hold it in place.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMembers of the Azorius Senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity and a pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and priorities revolve around legal issues.\n\nd8 | Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I try never to let my judgment become clouded by emotion.\n2 | I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I'm forced to deal with every day.\n3 | When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed.\n4 | I just want things the way I like them: neat, orderly, and clean.\n5 | No wrongdoing can escape my watchful gaze.\n6 | I always say exactly what I mean, no matter how many words it takes to communicate the particular nuance I am attempting to convey.\n7 | I'm very literal and don't appreciate metaphor or sarcasm.\n8 | I never change my mind once it's made up.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Order. The law is meant to ensure that the gears of society turn smoothly and quietly. (Lawful)\n3 | Peace. The ultimate object of the law is to remove violence from society. (Good)\n4 | Compliance. Coercion is a fine way of ensuring that the laws are obeyed. (Lawful)\n5 | Legislation. The law embodies excellence in its precision and detail. (Lawful)\n6 | Punishment. A public display of consequences is an excellent deterrent for other criminals. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate.\n2 | I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them.\n3 | I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator.\n4 | I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead.\n5 | One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard.\n6 | I've modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law.\n2 | I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all.\n3 | I have a secret, illegal vice.\n4 | I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child.\n5 | I'm incapable of deception.\n6 | I wish I had joined the Boros, but I fear they'd never accept me.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire city, your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into contact with members of other guilds, for good or ill.\n\nRoll twice on the Azorius Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Azorius Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | As a teenager, I was a page for a prominent judge.\n2 | One of my childhood friends is now a precognitive mage in service of the guild.\n3 | I joined the Azorius hoping to impress an arrester whom I admire.\n4 | My former mentor is now a warden at Udzec, the new Azorius prison.\n5 | I was second best at everything in my legal training, and now I work with the person who was always just a little bit better.\n6 | A good friend was promoted into work they can't tell me about.\n7 | I know a homunculus in the halls of New Prahv who can get things done behind the scenes.\n8 | I was once summoned to the presence of Supreme Judge Isperia, the guildmaster of the Azorius, who complimented me on my work.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | Roll an additional Azorius contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n2 | The person who recruited me into the Azorius left and joined the Boros.\n3 | I have a friendship with a Dimir agent who sometimes funnels me secrets about Azorius activities.\n4 | A Golgari spore druid would love to see me slip up and break the law.\n5 | A lesser Gruul chieftain seems to think I could be useful.\n6 | The black sheep of my family is putting their maniacal genius to use in the Izzet.\n7 | I'm friends with an Orzhov advokist; we compare notes on different forms of law magic.\n8 | I was ridiculed once in a Rakdos performance; the performer was impressed with my good humor about it and now does me occasional favors.\n9 | I have a fanatical Selesnya cousin who keeps trying to recruit me and everyone else in the family.\n10 | While growing up, I was bullied by a brat who's now a hybrid in the Simic Combine.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAs a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.\n\nAn Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets—and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.",

For the Tears you've been tasked with ferreting out the secrets of Phlan's criminal underworld, insurgency, and the common peoples of Phlan. In exchange for reporting on the activities of dissenters, criminals, and other rebel elements, the Tears of Virulence leave you alone to conduct your affairs in peace.\n\nIn reality you work for the deposed Black Fists, sharing misinformation with the Tears of Virulence that often helps the Black Fists and other Phlan insurgents.\n\nSince the evacuation of Phlan, you are even busier today than you ever were previously, as the number of dissenters among the refugees grows daily, while you are afforded many opportunities to spy on the peoples of Mulmaster and Elventree, to the pleasure of your contact(s) within the Tears of Virulence.\n\n\n### Feature: Double Agent\n\n\nYou have a reliable and trusty contact within the Tears of Virulence garrison in Phlan to whom you pass information and secrets. In exchange, you can get away with minor criminal offenses within the town of Phlan. In addition, your Black Fists contacts can help you secure an audience with the Lord Regent, the Lord Sage, members of the Black Fists, or deposed nobles and authority figures who are sympathetic to the Phlan refugees and insurgents. Note: This feature is a variant of the Noble feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | People are only as trustworthy as you are valuable to them. Always strive to be the most valuable person around.\n2 | My eloquence and sophistication are tools I use to avoid arousing suspicion myself.\n3 | I am a thrill-seeker, excited by covert and dangerous missions.\n4 | I live by my wits and always check every lock twice, just to be certain.\n5 | I never admit to my mistakes lest they be used against me.\n6 | I take every effort to be unnoticeable and blend into the crowd. Passersby rarely give me a second look.\n7 | I am prepared for any eventuality; including the day my usefulness as a spy comes to an end.\n8 | I always make certain to know my enemy before acting, lest I bite off more than I can chew.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Suspicious. In my experience, everybody has something to hide, and what they hide can usually hurt me. (Any)\n2 | Secretive. I trade in secrets, and am not about to let any of mine slip. (Any)\n3 | Hedonist. Life is short. I live my life to the fullest, as I know any day could be my last. (Chaotic)\n4 | Selfless. I use my position to help the downtrodden avoid persecution from the authorities. (Good)\n5 | Patriotic. I am a loyal supporter of Phlan and its leaders, and see my role as a solemn duty and necessary evil to prevent anarchy. (Lawful)\n6 | Manipulative. I use my knowledge to blackmail and manipulate others to my own benefit. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I was framed for a crime I did not commit, and seek to bring the true culprit to justice.\n2 | I am a part of an underground network that smuggles innocent civilians out of the city prior to being raided by the authorities.\n3 | I miss the glory days of Phlan, before the coming of the dragon.\n4 | I seek to prove myself worthy of joining the Black Fist as a member of their order.\n5 | My sister was killed by a Tear of Virulence, and now I feed them false information whenever possible.\n6 | My family was wrongly imprisoned, and I act as an informant in order to secure their release.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I think too highly of myself, and have an exaggerated sense of self-importance.\n2 | I have difficulty trusting strangers. I see spies and informants everywhere.\n3 | Years of getting away with minor crimes has left me believing that I am above the law, and have diplomatic immunity above my station.\n4 | Years of seeing innocent people suffer have left me despondent and pessimistic for the future.\n5 | My desire for vengeance often gets me into trouble.\n6 | I am spendthrift, and share my wealth with the patrons of my favorite tavern.",

    "entries": "- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set\n- **Languages:** Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur\n- **Equipment:** A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel's wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 2 gp (Boros-minted 1-zino coins)\n\n\n### Feature: Legion Station\n\n\nYou have an established place in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion. You can requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a salary of 1 gp (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin) per week, which (combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures.\n\n\n### Boros Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Boros Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | fire bolt, sacred flame\n1st | guiding bolt, heroism\n2nd | aid, scorching ray\n3rd | beacon of hope, blinding smite\n4th | death ward, wall of fire\n5th | flame strike\n\nYour magic often features dramatic bursts of flame or radiance. When you cast beneficial spells on your allies, they appear momentarily surrounded with halos of bright fire.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline. Its members share its leadership's devotion to the ideals of justice, or they find satisfaction in the more warfare-oriented aspects of the legion's work.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I approach every task with the same high degree of military precision.\n2 | I am always the first into the fray.\n3 | I bear any injury or indignity with stoic discipline.\n4 | My righteous wrath is easily inflamed by the slightest iniquity.\n5 | My honor is more important to me than my life.\n6 | Dangerous work is best accomplished by an orderly group working with common purpose.\n7 | I treat my weapons, uniform, and insignia with reverence, for they are gifts of the angels.\n8 | I pace when standing and fidget incessantly when forced to sit.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Justice. Achieving justice requires establishing fair, equitable, and compassionate relationships within a community. (Good)\n3 | Protection. It isn't right for innocents to suffer because of the arrogance of the powerful. (Good)\n4 | Solidarity. It is most crucial to act with a single will, marching side by side in perfect accord. (Lawful)\n5 | Order. Society functions only if people do their duty and respect the chain of command. (Lawful)\n6 | Conviction. Anything worth doing is worth doing with your whole heart. (Lawful)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I would lay down my life for Aurelia and the angels.\n2 | I owe my life to the Boros captain who took me in when I was living on the streets.\n3 | My fellow legionnaires are my family.\n4 | I wield the same Boros weapon my grandparent did, for the honor of our family.\n5 | I ran with the Rakdos in my youth, and I'm striving to atone for my past misdeeds.\n6 | I do what I can to help out the spouse of a comrade who died in battle.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I act bravely when I'm in a group, but I'm a coward when I'm alone.\n2 | I see everything in clear-cut black and white.\n3 | I'm just a little fascinated by the ways of the Gruul.\n4 | I trust the chain of command more than anything—more even than my closest friends.\n5 | I'm slow to trust members of other guilds.\n6 | I've been known to turn a blind eye to injustice, with the help of a modest bribe.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe ordered structure of the Boros Legion offers abundant opportunities to make friends—and rivals—in higher places. You might have close friends in other guilds that share the Boros emphasis on order and community, or bitter enemies among the guilds that represent chaos and destruction.\n\nRoll twice on the Boros Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Boros Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | A former comrade in arms was promoted into the prestigious Sunhome Guard.\n2 | One of my parents is a ranking Boros officer.\n3 | A close friend serves aboard the Parhelion II, a flying fortress.\n4 | I had a tangled affair with a Boros garrison captain.\n5 | I have maintained a relationship with one of my instructors at Horizon Military Academy.\n6 | I competed with a fellow student for the attention of a mentor at Horizon Military Academy.\n7 | The person who recruited me into the legion changed the course of my life.\n8 | A Boros angel knows my name.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | One of my siblings is an Azorius arrester.\n2 | Roll an additional Boros contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n3 | I showed mercy to an injured, now-grateful Dimir spy.\n4 | I suspect someone I know is a Golgari assassin, but I can't prove it.\n5 | An adolescent relative ran off to join the Gruul in an act of rebellion and has not yet returned.\n6 | I once befriended an Izzet scientist, and we're still cordial though the relationship ended messily.\n7 | I owe a monetary debt to an Orzhov syndic.\n8 | A Rakdos blood witch seems to enjoy harassing me.\n9 | I tried to recruit a friend who ended up joining the Selesnya.\n10 | I keep running into a particular Simic biomancer, and I enjoy the arguments that inevitably result.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAs a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.\n\nAs a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.\n\nTajic is a firefist who carries the exalted title of Blade of the Legion, putting him just below the angels in rank. He maintains close communication with Aurelia, though recent events in the city have set them at odds. Tajic believes that the Boros can trust only the Boros. He is convinced that any effort at peace among the guilds is doomed to failure without the Guildpact. The Boros, he argues, would be better off spending their energy to make themselves stronger so they can uphold the fragile balance that exists now—and protect the innocent when the balance tilts. Aurelia feels that his negative attitude runs the risk of poisoning the hearts of the other Boros and undermining any peace efforts. For the most part, in deference to the angel, Tajic keeps his views to himself.",

You pride yourself at having traveled every major trade way in the Moonsea region, including the best backroads and shortcuts. When traveling these roads, you know where the best inns, campsites, and water sources are located, as well as potential locations of danger such as ambush. Having worked the roads as long as you have, you have made many acquaintances and find it easy to pick up information and rumors floating from town to town. You are skilled with beasts of burden and handling and repairing wagons of all kinds.\n\n\n### Feature: Wagonmaster\n\n\nYou are used to being in charge of the operation and your reputation for reliability has you on a short list when the job is critical. Experience has taught you to rely on your gut. Others recognize this and look to you for direction when a situation gets serious. You are able to identify the most defensible locations for camping. If you are part of a caravan outfit, you are able to attract two additional workers that are loyal to you based on your reputation. You have an excellent memory for maps and geography and can always determine your cardinal directions while traveling. Note: This feature is a variant of the Outlander feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | Any group is only as strong as its weakest link. Everyone has to pull their own weight. \n2 | There's always someone out there trying to take what I've got. Always be vigilant.\n3 | Anything can be learned if you have the right teacher. Most folks just need a chance.\n4 | Early to bed and early to rise; this much at least is under my control.\n5 | You can listen to me or don't and wish you had. Everyone ends up on one side of that fence.\n6 | Eventually my hard work will be rewarded. Maybe that time has finally come.\n7 | A strong ox or horse is more reliable than most people I've met.\n8 | I never had time for books, but wish I had. I admire folks who have taken the time to learn.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Service. Using my talents to help others is the best way of helping myself. (Good)\n2 | Selfish. What people don't know WILL hurt them, but why is that my problem? (Evil)\n3 | Wanderer. I go where the road takes me. Sometimes that's a good thing... (Chaotic)\n4 | Fittest. On the open road, the law of nature wins. Victims are the unprepared. (Lawful)\n5 | Focused. I simply have a job to do, and I'm going to do it. (Neutral)\n6 | Motivated. There's a reason I'm good at what I do, I pay attention to the details. (Any) \n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My brother has a farm in Elmwood and I've helped him and his neighbors move their goods to Mulmaster and other surrounding towns. Those are good people.\n2 | A caravan I lead was attacked by bandits and many innocents died. I swear that I will avenge them by killing any bandits I encounter.\n3 | The Soldiery are mostly good guys who understand the importance of protecting the roads. The City Watch is who you have to look out for. If they are inspecting your goods, get ready to pay a fine.\n4 | The new commander of Southroad Tower, Capt. Holke, understands the importance of safe roads. He's hired me for several jobs and I'm grateful.\n5 | There's always a road I haven't traveled before. I'm always looking for new places to explore.\n6 | Wealth and power mean little without the freedom to go where and when you want.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have trouble trusting people I've just met.\n2 | I enjoy the open road. Underground and tight spaces make me very nervous.\n3 | I expect others to heed my orders and have little respect or sympathy if they don't.\n4 | I am very prideful and have trouble admitting when I'm wrong.\n5 | Once I decide on a course of action, I do not waiver.\n6 | I like to explore, and my curiosity will sometimes get me into trouble.",

You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nScions of celebrity adventurers must deal with fame that's not theirs, wealth they didn't earn, and expectations they can never hope to meet. These hardships can have adverse effects, but those who cope with them can arrive at a decent attitude and a grounded worldview. Those who fail become bitter—or worse.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I will never get out of my famous parent's shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden.\n2 | I've seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers.\n3 | Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I'm going to do it.\n4 | I'm used to the very best in life, and that's a hard habit to break.\n5 | My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me.\n6 | No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can.\n7 | I've been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you.\n8 | No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies... and taking their stuff.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Power. The only way to get ahead in this world is to attain power and hold onto it with all your might. (Evil)\n2 | Peace. Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything. (Lawful)\n3 | Fame. I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral)\n4 | Training. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to success—and eventually to perfection. (Any)\n5 | Anonymity. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any)\n6 | Wisdom. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone.\n2 | I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.\n3 | Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud.\n4 | My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession.\n5 | My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.\n6 | Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | You don't know what I'm going through. You never can.\n2 | You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while.\n3 | My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth.\n4 | Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them.\n5 | My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death.\n6 | You have to look out for yourself. No one else will.",

They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.\n2 | I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.\n3 | Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.\n4 | I'm a born gambler who can't resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.\n5 | I lie about almost everything, even when there's no reason to.\n6 | Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.\n7 | I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment.\n8 | I pocket anything I see that might have some value.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)\n2 | Fairness. I never target people who can't afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful)\n3 | Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good)\n4 | Creativity. I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic)\n5 | Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever. (Good)\n6 | Aspiration. I'm determined to make something of myself. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about.\n2 | I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere.\n3 | Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her.\n4 | I come from a noble family, and one day I'll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me.\n5 | A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.\n6 | I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I can't resist a pretty face.\n2 | I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.\n3 | I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.\n4 | I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved.\n5 | I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.\n6 | I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough.",

A request for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up the chain to an undisclosed Spireling for approval. This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled. If muscle is requested, an NPC member of the Clasp can temporarily aid your party. If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you've been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into breaking you out or paying off the jailer.\n\nAt some point, the favor will be called in for repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered. It's the GM's prerogative to ensure that the syndicate's request is proportionate to the favor they bestowed—or that they compensate you in other ways for a service that goes beyond the scope of repaying the initial favor.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe Clasp enjoys a strange status in Tal'Dorei. The syndicate is a feared group of thieves and killers, whose name is often invoked only in whispers. But at the same time, the organization has a reputation for guerilla heroism, in response to its members having saved countless lives when the Chroma Conclave attacked Emon. And so like every Clasp member, your own reputation often swings between these two poles.\n\nYour bond is likely associated with your fellow Clasp members or the individual who introduced you to the syndicate. Your ideal probably involves establishing your importance and indispensability to the Clasp.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | What's life without risk? I'm always willing to take a risk if the reward seems worth it.\n2 | I only show my emotions around people I really trust.\n3 | I don't need friends; I need allies. When I do make \"friends,\" I only consider what they can do for me.\n4 | I look for simple solutions. The world's full of tough problems, but a well-placed knife is a one-size-fits-all answer.\n5 | Money talks. I don't. We've got an efficient relationship.\n6 | I used to have one rule—don't get involved in other people's problems. Why are things so complicated now?\n7 | Crime is a game, and I play to win. I have no sympathy for players who don't get that.\n8 | This organization has a lot of folks who cling to ugly, brutal practices. I'm not like that. I'm a professional, and professionals have standards.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | By Any Means. I complete jobs. Collateral damage isn't my problem. (Chaotic)\n2 | Ambition. I will climb to the top of the ladder. Everything I do is a stepping-stone to a Spireling's position. (Neutral)\n3 | Decisiveness. It's important to make up your mind so you can act swiftly and without delay. (Neutral)\n4 | Honor. There's room in the Clasp for both good and evil. Every day, I awake and choose to do what's right. (Good)\n5 | Family. The Clasp is family. Anything that's good for the family is good for me. (Lawful)\n6 | Self-Interest. There are too many bleeding hearts in the Clasp these days. Doing the right thing means doing the thing that makes my life better. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I'd do anything—anything—to protect my comrades.\n2 | I'll always be grateful to the Spireling who took me in when I was an orphaned kid.\n3 | I was inspired to join the Clasp by the stories my parents told of being saved from the Chroma Conclave's attack on Emon. I can look past the organization's flaws.\n4 | I was nearly killed by the Myriad. If the Clasp is the enemy of those villains, then the Clasp is my friend.\n5 | I've got family back in the old town who are counting on me for money. They don't know how I get it, but they don't need to know.\n6 | I joined the Clasp to become rich, powerful, and beloved. That's all there is to it.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm hopeless at organizing my belongings, and I'm always losing things.\n2 | I get bored whenever a plan is going too smoothly. A win is always more fun when it's by the skin of my teeth!\n3 | I've seen Spirelings walk out among cheering crowds of thousands. Gods, I wish that were me. I need that to be me.\n4 | I'm rubbish with money, and never seem to leave town with a full purse. Keeps me coming back to the life, I suppose.\n5 | I can't work with shoddy, makeshift thieves' tools. I need everything involving my work to be perfect.\n6 | Any slight against me, no matter how small, is cause for revenge.",

If you up grew in the camps, you have never been to a settlement other than the village of Elventree. As a guest of the elves, you have learned their ways and the ways of the forest. You are also a traumatized, as residual wild magic, energies released by the fall of Thultanthar upon Myth Drannor, and the constant fear of raids hunting for non-humans to fight in Hillsfar's Arena have taken their toll on you, as they have on everyone in the camps.\n\n\n### Feature: Shelter of the Elven Clergy\n\n\nThe clerics of Elventree have vowed to care for the Cormanthor refugees. They will help you when they can, including providing you and your companions with free healing and care at temples, shrines, and other established presences in Elventree. They will also provide you (but only you) with a poor lifestyle. Note: This feature is a variant of the Acolyte feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I long for a home that never really existed, whether in the camps, Hillsfar, or Myth Drannor.\n2 | Though I am not an elf, I am a fervent, radical worshipper of the elven gods.\n3 | I live in the moment, knowing my life could be turned upside down any day.\n4 | I appreciate beauty in all of its forms.\n5 | I hate the dark elves and the Netherese for each driving the elves out of Cormanthyr in the past.\n6 | I am a forest bumpkin who grew up in a tent in the woods and is wholly ignorant of city life.\n7 | I was raised alongside children of many other races. I harbor no racial prejudices at all.\n8 | The elves have just the right word for so many things that cannot be expressed as well in other languages. I pepper my speech with elven words, phrases, and sayings.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Patient. The elves have taught me to think and plan for the long-term. (Lawful)\n2 | Rebellious. Governments and politicians drove my family to the camps. I subtly defy authority whenever I think I can get away with it. (Chaotic)\n3 | Self - Absorbed. I've had to look out for number one so long that it has become second nature. (Any)\n4 | Wanderlust. I want to see as much of the world beyond the camps as I can. (Any)\n5 | Generous. I give everything I can to help those in need, regardless of who they are. (Good)\n6 | To the Abyss with Them. The people of Hillsfar cast me out. I won't risk my hide to help them. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | The elves took me in when I had nowhere else to go. In return, I do what I can to help elves in need.\n2 | I seek revenge against the people of Hillsfar for driving my family into the forest.\n3 | My family lost everything when they were driven from Hillsfar. I strive to rebuild that fortune.\n4 | The forest has provided me with food and shelter. In return, I protect forests and those who dwell within.\n5 | I am deeply, tragically in love with someone whose racial lifespan is far longer or shorter than mine.\n6 | Members of my extended family did not make it to the camps or have been kidnapped to fight in the Arena. I search for them tirelessly.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I am very uncomfortable indoors and underground.\n2 | I am haughty. I grew up among the elves and emulate them. Other races are crude in comparison.\n3 | Elf this, elf that. I am sick and tired of the elves.\n4 | I am a miser. Having lost everything once before, I clutch my possessions and wealth very tightly.\n5 | I am a moocher. I am so used to others providing for me that I have come to expect everyone to do it.\n6 | I believe the gods have cursed me, my family, and all of the Cormanthor refugees.

That will never happen again.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.\n2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.\n3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.\n4 | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.\n5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.\n6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed.

The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.\n\nWhenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.\n\nConsider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.\n\nd8 | Reason for Infiltration\n--- | ---\n1 | My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.\n2 | I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.\n3 | I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.\n4 | I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.\n5 | I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.\n6 | I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.\n7 | I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.\n8 | I chose this guild at random or on a lark.\n\n\n### Dimir Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | encode thoughts, mage hand\n1st | disguise self, sleep\n2nd | detect thoughts, pass without trace\n3rd | gaseous form, meld into stone, nondetection\n4th | arcane eye, freedom of movement\n5th | modify memory\n\nYour magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the encode thoughts cantrip described below, you can turn a creature's thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nSkilled at infiltration, disguise, and deception, members of House Dimir appear inscrutable. Your true personality and ideals might never manifest, or they might mark you as a quirky member of your secondary guild.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm good at hiding my true thoughts and feelings.\n2 | When I'm in doubt about revealing something, I assume it's a secret, and I don't share it.\n3 | I like to sound mysterious, because wisdom hidden grows deeper with time.\n4 | I have no patience with people who get in my way.\n5 | I love hearing about other people's nightmares.\n6 | Combat is meant to be quick, clean, and one-sided.\n7 | I like to stick to the shadows.\n8 | I never show my anger. I just plot my revenge.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My true guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Control. I like pulling the strings. (Lawful)\n3 | Secrets. I collect secrets and never reveal them. (Any)\n4 | Knowledge. I want to know as much as I can about this city and how it works. (Any)\n5 | Independence. I value the freedom to pursue my own goals without interference. (Chaotic)\n6 | Nihilism. I don't believe in anything, and anyone who does is a fool. (Neutral)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncover—including my guild superiors.\n2 | I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.\n3 | The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful.\n4 | I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets!\n5 | I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster.\n6 | Someone has discovered my true identity.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I like secrets so much that I'm reluctant to share details of a plan even with those who need to know.\n2 | I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity.\n3 | I have trouble trusting anyone but myself.\n4 | I have a particular vice that puts all my secrets at risk if I'm not careful.\n5 | I'm pretty sure I've done something horrible that I can't remember because of the guild's mind magic.\n6 | I put too much trust in the people who give me orders.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nAs an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you have limited contacts within your guild. Your relationships within your secondary guild, in the guise of your false identity, are usually more extensive.\n\nRoll once on the Dimir Contacts table, giving you an ally who serves as your contact in Dimir. Then roll twice on the table for your secondary guild. The first roll gives you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | I know a Dimir courier who relays messages to me from someone higher up the chain of command.\n2 | I get orders from a shapeshifter I recognize only through a series of code phrases we exchange.\n3 | An ostentatiously wealthy vampire is my secret guild superior, summoning me to a luxurious estate by means of coded messages.\n4 | I have never met my guild contact, but I receive telepathic messages, usually in my dreams.\n5 | I've never met my guild contact, but I get coded messages from a pattern of street lights and graffiti.\n6 | I didn't discover the identity of my guild contact until after we had begun a romantic relationship.\n7 | My superior maintains an elaborate identity as a young street urchin... unless it's all a lie, and I'm being sent on ridiculous missions by a twisted child.\n8 | My sibling and I both get telepathic orders from a mysterious contact, and I'm starting to question the authenticity of my sibling's orders.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAs a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.\n\nLike any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.",

    "entries": "- **Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, Survival\n- **Tool Proficiencies:** Special (see origin below)\n- **Languages:** Draconic\n- **Equipment:** A dagger, tattered rags, a loaf of moldy bread, a small cast-off scale belonging to Vorgansharax—the Maimed Virulence, and a pouch with 5 gp of various coins (salvaged during your escape from Phlan).\n\n\n### Lifestyle\n\n\nWretched\n\n\n### Overview\n\n\nWhen the Maimed Virulence descended upon Phlan, you were one of the unfortunate casualties of war. Captured during the initial assault, you have spent the last year of your life as a plaything of a capricious and malevolent overlord.\n\nWhile many of your fellow prisoners fell to the dragon's insatiable fury over the coming months, you and your fellow \"survivors\" were spared only for a worse fate as one of the dragon's magical experiments, leaving you and those who survived the torture scarred and disfigured.\n\nWhat reasons the dragon had for releasing you few survivors, nobody knows. You only fear that those who died under his terrible claw were the lucky ones, and you and your fellow Dragonscarred are doomed for a fate worse than death.\n\n\n### Origin\n\n\nPrior to the coordinated attack by the Maimed Virulence and her rebel Black Fist supporters, you were once a citizen or visitor to Phlan. While the trauma of your recent ordeal has greatly altered your motivations and perception of the world, your former life still clings to you and colors your mannerisms, behaviors, and outlook on life. Choose one entry on the following table (or roll randomly) to determine your former occupation prior to your incarceration and torture. Your choice determines your tool proficiency from this background.\n\nd8 | Origin (Occupation) | Tool Proficiency\n--- | --- | ---\n1 | Dockworker/Fisherman | Vehicles (water)\n2 | Tradesperson/Merchant | Artisan's tools\n3 | Black Fist Soldier | Gaming set or Vehicles (land)\n4 | Adventurer/Visitor | Vehicles (land)\n5 | Entertainer | Musical Instrument\n6 | Scholar/Healer | Alchemist's Supplies or Herbalism kit\n7 | Criminal | thieves' tools, forgery kit, or Disguise kit\n8 | Unskilled Laborer | Gaming set\n\n\n### Feature: Dragonscarred\n\n\nOver a period of several months you were subject to magical and mundane torture at the claws of Vorgansharax and his minions. These experiments have left you horribly disfigured but mark you as a survivor of the Maimed Virulence. This affords you a measure of fame and notoriety, for those who know of your harrowing ordeal are keen to hear the tale personally but makes it difficult to disguise your appearance and hide from prying eyes.\n\nYou can parlay this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your companions. Nobles, scholars, mages, and those who seek to ferret out the secrets of the Maimed Virulence would all be keen to hear your tale of survival, and learn what secrets (if any) you might possess, and/or study your affliction with great interest. However, you fear that your afflictions are not completely mundane and that the Maimed Virulence may as yet have some nefarious reason for allowing your escape, as your scars burn with acidic fury and seem to writhe beneath your skin at times. Note: This feature is a variant of the Far Traveler feature.\n\n\n### Disfigurement (Optional)\n\n\nIn addition to extensive scarring, you may choose one of the following options to represent your disfigurement. This disfigurement is purely cosmetic, misshapen, and horrific to look upon.\n\nd8 | Disfigurement\n--- | ---\n1 | Small non-functional wing(s).\n2 | Misshapen, wing-like membranes along one or both arms.\n3 | Elongated, claw-like hand(s).\n4 | Elongated, claw-like feet.\n5 | Painful green scales randomly embedded in skin.\n6 | Bulbous, reptilian eye(s).\n7 | Enlarged dorsal spines.\n8 | Hair replaced with small irregular spines.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I am driven to escape my past, and rarely stay in one place long.\n2 | I know secrets of the Maimed Virulence, but fear the harm that may befall me should others learn them.\n3 | Speaking of my ordeal helps sooth the still open wounds in my soul.\n4 | My former life is meaningless, and was ripped to shreds by the claws of Vorgansharax. All that matters now is what I do with the future.\n5 | I have faced the worst a dragon can deliver and survived. I am fearless, and my resolve unshakable.\n6 | I am haunted my tortured past, and wake at night screaming at half-remembered horrors.\n7 | I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, and a weapon within arm's reach.\n8 | I am slow to trust, but incredibly loyal to those who have earned it.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Survivor. No matter the cost, I will take any action necessary to survive. (Any)\n2 | Independence. When in trouble, the only person I can rely on is myself. (Chaotic)\n3 | Compassionate. I have suffered long at the hands of a Dragon, and take pity and compassion on the suffering of others. (Good)\n4 | Secretive. I am withdrawn, and hide my monstrous appearance for fear of drawing unwanted attention. (Chaotic)\n5 | Justice. I have been wronged, and will not allow the same fate to befall others. (Lawful)\n6 | Sycophant. During my ordeal, I became a willing servant of the Maimed Virulence, and spy on his behalf. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I have sworn vengeance on the Maimed Virulence and those that follow him.\n2 | I long to reunite with friends and family who may dwell among the Phlan Refugees, and protect them.\n3 | While a prisoner of the Maimed Virulence, I overheard rumors of an item or treasure the Dragon seeks. I will have that treasure for myself!\n4 | I seek to reclaim and rebuild my former life to the best of my ability.\n5 | I have been reborn as a child of Vorgansharax. I will claim my birthright as his chosen heir and successor.\n6 | I attribute my survival to the work of the divine, and seek to prove myself worthy of the honor.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have been touched with dragon-greed, and have a lust for wealth which can never be satisfied.\n2 | I secretly believe others are plotting to harm me.\n3 | I no longer enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Food is but ashes and bile in my throat.\n4 | Anyone who refuses to celebrate my celebrity does not deserve my company.\n5 | I am paranoid and overly suspicious of others. Anyone may be an agent of the Maimed Virulence.\n6 | Once I make up my mind, I follow my chosen course of action regardless of the consequences.",

You have spent a great deal of time living among the dwarves, goliaths, and denizens of the Underdark that also work mines in the area. At this point, you're just as comfortable working underground as above. You know how to read a seam, dicker for supplies with the deep gnomes, party with dwarves, and find your way back to the surface afterwards. Unfortunately, you haven't struck it rich...yet. Although you've come to Mulmaster looking for work, the tall peaks and deep mines of the Earthspurs still call to you.\n\n\n### Feature: Deep Miner\n\n\nYou are used to navigating the deep places of the earth. You never get lost in caves or mines if you have either seen an accurate map of them or have been through them before. Furthermore, you are able to scrounge fresh water and food for yourself and as many as five other people each day if you are in a mine or natural caves.

Whether with dwarves, or goliaths, or deep gnomes, I can find a way to have a good time.\n5 | I'd rather be mining. This is okay; mining is better.\n6 | I think that I will stumble upon great riches if I just keep looking.\n7 | People who don't work with their hands and who live in houses are soft and weak.\n8 | I wish I were more educated. I look up to people who are.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Generosity. The riches of the earth are to be shared by all. (Good)\n2 | Greed. Gems and precious metals, I want them all for myself.

I will do anything to protect them.\n2 | A deep gnome saved my life when I was injured and alone. I owe his people a great debt.\n3 | I must behold and preserve the natural beauty of places below the earth.\n4 | Gems hold a special fascination for me, more than gold, land, magic, or power.\n5 | I want to explore new depths and scale new heights.\n6 | Someday I'm going to find the mother lode, then I'll spend the rest of my life in luxury.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm uncomfortable spending time under the open sky. I'd rather be indoors or underground.\n2 | I'm not used to being around other people much and sometimes get grouchy about it.\n3 | Good tools are more reliable than people. In a cave in, I would save a sturdy pick before a stranger.\n4 | I jealously guard my secrets, because I think others will take advantage of me if they learn what I know.\n5 | I am obsessed with getting rich.

At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure.

This persona is as natural to them as their hidden, true face, but it disguises their identity. Roll on the Faceless Persona table to determine your persona, or work with the DM to create a persona that's unique to your character and suits the tone of your game.\n\nd10 | Faceless Persona\n--- | ---\n1 | A flamboyant spy or brigand\n2 | The incarnation of a nation or people\n3 | A scoundrel with a masked guise\n4 | A vengeful spirit\n5 | The manifestation of a deity or your faith\n6 | One whose beauty is greatly accented using makeup\n7 | An impersonation of another hero\n8 | The embodiment of a school of magic\n9 | A warrior with distinctive armor\n10 | A disguise with animalistic or monstrous characteristics, meant to inspire fear\n\n\n### Feature: Dual Personalities\n\n\nMost of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nA faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That's all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm earnest and uncommonly direct.\n2 | I strive to have no personality—it's easier to forget what's hardly there.\n3 | I treasure a memento of the person or instance that set me upon my path.\n4 | I sleep just as much as I need to and on an unusual schedule.\n5 | I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming.\n6 | I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length.\n7 | I am ever learning how to be among others—when to stay quiet, when to laugh.\n8 | I behave like an extreme opposite of my persona.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Justice. Place in society shouldn't determine one's access to what is right. (Good)\n2 | Security. Doing what must be done can't bring the innocent to harm. (Lawful)\n3 | Confusion. Deception is a weapon. Strike from where your foes won't expect. (Chaotic)\n4 | Infamy. My name will be a malediction, a curse that fulfills my will. (Evil)\n5 | Incorruptibility. Be a symbol, and leave your flawed being behind. (Any)\n6 | Anonymity. It's my deeds that should be remembered, not their instrument. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I do everything for my family. My first thought is keeping them safe.\n2 | What I do, I do for the world. The people don't realize how much they need me.\n3 | I've seen too many in need. I must not fail them as everyone else has.\n4 | I stand in opposition, lest the wicked go unopposed.\n5 | I am exceptional. I do this because no one else can, and no one can stop me.\n6 | I do everything for those who were taken from me.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I am callous about death. It comes to us all eventually.\n2 | I never make eye contact or hold it unflinchingly.\n3 | I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing.\n4 | I overexert myself, sometimes needing to recuperate for a day or more.\n5 | I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming.\n6 | I see morality entirely in black and white.",

You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nBeing a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won't make that mistake again.\n2 | Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well.\n3 | To prosper, you have to be in control.\n4 | The customer is always right.\n5 | I was cutting corners and breaking deals to maximize profit. That's why I failed.\n6 | When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its execution—even if it's a terrible idea.\n7 | If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support.\n8 | My heart wasn't in being a merchant, so I failed. I'm not all that keen on adventuring either, but I need the money.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Survival. Where there's life, there's hope. If I remain alive and flexible, I can succeed. (Any)\n2 | Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'll pay it forward. (Good)\n3 | Excitement. Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I'm not going to let it hold me back now. (Chaotic)\n4 | Wealth. With enough coin, I can buy comfort, power, knowledge, and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me and money. (Evil)\n5 | Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession, like adventuring. (Lawful)\n6 | Redemption. Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My family means everything to me. I failed them before, and I must not do so again.\n2 | My church provides a connection to my god, so I must ensure that it is protected and funded.\n3 | My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family.\n4 | If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on.\n5 | Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them.\n6 | I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy, they let my debt rest unpaid.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town?\n2 | I must have the best of everything. Like, right now.\n3 | You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance and low breeding.\n4 | I failed, but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck.\n5 | I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where's my belt pouch?\n6 | Nothing gets between me and danger except my fellow adventurers. So I'll be sure to put them there.",

Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic)\n5 | Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful)\n6 | Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the \"rule of three\" everywhere. (Lawful)\n7 | Obsession. I won't let go of a grudge. (Evil)\n8 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause.

My poor sense of time means I'm always late.\n2 | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.\n3 | I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule.\n4 | I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure.\n5 | I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things.\n6 | I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.\n7 | I have many vices and tend to indulge them.\n8 | I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always.",

If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.\n\n\n### Fishing Tale\n\n\nYou can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale.\n\nd8 | Tale\n--- | ---\n1 | Lobster Wrestling. You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster.\n2 | It Dragged the Boat. You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles.\n3 | Fins of Pure Gold. You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it.\n4 | Ghost Fish. You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see.\n5 | Nemesis Clam. A large clam containing a pearl the size of your head claimed one of your fingers before jetting away; one day, you'll find that clam.\n6 | It Swallowed the Sun. You once saw a fish leap from the water and turn day into night.\n7 | Dive into the Abyss. You found yourself in an underwater cave leading to the Abyss, and your luck has been sour ever since.\n8 | Love Story. You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nFishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly. Fishers tend to be superstitious, forming attachments to particular fishing lures or special fishing spots. They have a connection to the bodies of water in which they fish, and they think poorly of those whose actions adversely affect their livelihood.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I am unmoved by the wrath of nature.\n2 | My friends are my crew; we sink or float together.\n3 | I need long stretches of quiet to clear my head.\n4 | Rich folk don't know the satisfaction of hard work.\n5 | I laugh heartily, feel deeply, and fear nothing.\n6 | I work hard; nature offers no handouts.\n7 | I dislike bargaining; state your price and mean it.\n8 | Luck favors me, and I take risks others might not.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Camaraderie. Good people make even the longest voyage bearable. (Good)\n2 | Luck. Our luck depends on respecting its rules—now throw this salt over your shoulder. (Lawful)\n3 | Daring. The richest bounty goes to those who risk everything. (Chaotic)\n4 | Plunder. Take all that you can and leave nothing for the scavengers. (Evil)\n5 | Balance. Do not fish the same spot twice in a row; suppress your greed, and nature will reward you. (Neutral)\n6 | Hard Work. No wave can move a soul hard at work. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I lost something important in the deep sea, and I intend to find it.\n2 | Someone else's greed destroyed my livelihood, and I will be compensated.\n3 | I will fish the many famous waters of this land.\n4 | The gods saved me during a terrible storm, and I will honor their gift.\n5 | My destiny awaits me at the bottom of a particular pond in the Feywild.\n6 | I must repay my village's debt.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I am judgmental, especially of those I deem homebodies or otherwise lazy.\n2 | I become depressed and anxious if I'm away from the sea too long.\n3 | I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others.\n4 | I am inclined to tell long-winded stories at inopportune times.\n5 | I work hard, but I play harder.\n6 | I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits.",

You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.\n\n\n### Specialty\n\n\nYou previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger.

During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, you can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM's determination.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nSome gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune.

Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I plan for every contingency. Leave nothing to chance!\n2 | Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity.\n3 | I'm one of Lady Luck's favored.

I just have to keep my eyes open.\n8 | I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I'll be back at the card table.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Knowledge.

If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic)\n4 | Survival. You can't win if you're dead. Live to fight another day—when the odds might be more in your favor. (Any)\n5 | Reliability.

They remember you fondly and help you in little ways when they can. You can invoke their assistance in and around Hillsfar to obtain food, as well as simple equipment for temporary use. You can also invoke it to gain access to the low-security areas of their garrisons, halls, and encampments.

I can find anyone a spouse!\n7 | I think money is the true measure of appreciation and affection. Everything else is talk or an act.\n8 | I don't like having a lot of stuff, just a few simple things I need.

There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived.\n4 | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you.\n5 | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.\n6 | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you.\n\n\n### Building a Giant Foundling Character\n\n\nYour life among giants has given you a unique perspective.

Nobody talks down to me!\n3 | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern.\n4 | I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated.\n5 | Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.\n6 | The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it.",

When you aren't in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.\n\n\n### Golgari Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Golgari Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | dancing lights, spare the dying\n1st | entangle, ray of sickness\n2nd | protection from poison, ray of enfeeblement, spider climb\n3rd | animate dead, plant growth\n4th | giant insect, grasping vine\n5th | cloudkill, insect plague\n\nGolgari magic is often accompanied by a sickly green glow and a rotting stench.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMembers of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death's inevitable approach.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll.\n2 | I like to remind people of their inevitable demise.\n3 | Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does.\n4 | I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me.\n5 | I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it.\n6 | Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action.\n7 | I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail.\n8 | Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm provoked—and I'm easily provoked.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Stoicism. All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral)\n3 | Nature. The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral)\n4 | Interdependence. We are all part of nature's web. (Lawful)\n5 | Ambition. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil)\n6 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa.\n2 | I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be.\n3 | I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance.\n4 | I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission.\n5 | I found something in the sewer that must never come to light.\n6 | I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off.\n2 | I assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me.\n3 | I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground.\n4 | I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words.\n5 | I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless.\n6 | I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nTo the extent that the Golgari Swarm acts like a single organism, you are connected to every other member in some way or another. Convinced that the rest of the world is out to get you, you find it easy to form close bonds with your guild mates, and harder to make meaningful connections with others.\n\nRoll twice on the Golgari Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Golgari Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | One of my parents is an elite assassin, a member of the Ochran.\n2 | I learned combat from a kraul.\n3 | I know a medusa who is stationed in the guildhall.\n4 | I had a torrid romance with a spore druid responsible for a large rot farm.\n5 | There's a troll in a remote area of the undercity who seems to find me interesting—and who knows more than you'd think.\n6 | An elf lich is determined to see me become a lich someday, too.\n7 | A medusa decided it would be more fun to recruit me into the guild than to kill me.\n8 | I know a findbroker who can locate just about anything, for the right price.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | An Azorius arrester I literally pulled out of the gutter will do anything for me.\n2 | Someone joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the sergeant of that Boros squad would love to prove that it was me.\n3 | I had a romance with a Dimir agent whom I still feed secrets to.\n4 | Roll an additional Golgari contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n5 | I joined the Gruul in a battle against the Boros once, and the chief of that small clan thanks me for turning the tide.\n6 | An Izzet scientist resents that I sold a scrapped invention I found in the sewer.\n7 | My undercity explorations led me into an Orzhov vault, and a spirit thinks I stole something valuable.\n8 | I found a baby beast and sold it to a Rakdos wrangler who remains grateful to me.\n9 | A Selesnya druid and I share an interest in the same garden, and we have enjoyable arguments there.\n10 | I regularly pick up refuse from beneath a Simic laboratory, and sometimes I talk to the researcher who dumps it there.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAs part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.\n\nA classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.\n\nYou might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.\n\nThe shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.",

In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the \"Ballad of the Grinning Fool\" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion.\n\nThis feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nGrinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I love the spotlight.

A nation built upon just foundations will uphold freedom for all. (Law)\n4 | Expression. Music, joy, and laughter are the keys to freedom. (Good)\n5 | Self-Determination. People should be free to do as they please. (Chaotic)\n6 | Vigilance. A free people must be carefully taught, lest they be misled. (Neutral)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall.\n2 | The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them.\n3 | Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I'll use music to change the world.\n4 | I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived.\n5 | All life is precious to me. I know I can change the world without taking a humanoid life.\n6 | The elite in their ivory towers don't understand how we suffer. I intend to show them.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I've never lied once in my life. What? No, I'm not crossing my fingers!\n2 | I do everything big! Subtlety? I don't know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that's a problem?\n3 | Being a spy in wartime is painful. I've seen so much suffering, I think I'm losing my mind.\n4 | I can't focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play!\n5 | Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover?\n6 | I can't afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone.",

You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.\n\n\n### Gruul Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | fire bolt, produce flame\n1st | compelled duel, speak with animals, thunderwave\n2nd | beast sense, shatter\n3rd | conjure animals, conjure barrage\n4th | dominate beast, stoneskin\n5th | destructive wave\n\nFueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nGruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | Unlike people, the beasts of the wild are friends who won't stab me in the back.\n2 | Go ahead and insult me—I dare you.\n3 | I scorn those who can't survive away from the comforts of the city.\n4 | Don't tell me I'm not allowed to do something.\n5 | Laws are for people who are afraid to face their inner beasts.\n6 | I smear the blood of my enemies over my skin.\n7 | I was, in fact, raised by maaka.\n8 | HarrRRAAGGHH! [I rarely form a coherent sentence and prefer to express myself by breaking things.]\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Clan. My clan is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Anarchy. No person or law or custom can tell another what to do. (Chaotic)\n3 | Nature. We weren't born tame or domesticated, so we shouldn't have to live that way. (Neutral)\n4 | Might. The strongest are meant to dominate the weak. (Evil)\n5 | Rage. AAAAAARRRRggggh! [To live is to feel and express the rage burning in your belly.] (Chaotic)\n6 | Tradition. The Old Ways must be preserved and upheld. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I am determined that one day I will lead my clan—or a new one.\n2 | I would give my life for my clan chieftain.\n3 | The chieftain of another clan has a grudge against me.\n4 | I am devoted to a sacred site in the midst of the rubblebelt.\n5 | My weapon is made from the first raktusk I ever hunted.\n6 | GrrrRRAAAAGGHH! [I will do anything to prove myself greater than my siblings or ancestors.]\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | If you question my courage, I will never back down.\n2 | HrrrGGGAAAARRuuuh! [My anger in battle led to the death of a loved one.]\n3 | I'm as stubborn as a batterboar.\n4 | I'm so convinced of my superiority over soft, civilized people that I'll take great risks to prove it.\n5 | I'm easily manipulated by people I find attractive.\n6 | I'm not actually all that angry.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe members of the Gruul Clans rely on each other even as they vie for territory and glory. Their encounters with members of other guilds are more often violent than friendly, but occasional bonds do form.\n\nRoll twice on the Gruul Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Gruul Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | One of my parents is a renowned warrior in my clan.\n2 | My sibling has the ear of the clan chief.\n3 | I have cousins in a different clan.\n4 | When we were younger, I was romantically involved with a prominent warrior in my clan.\n5 | A druid in my clan believes I have a destiny to fulfill.\n6 | The warrior who trained me remembers me for my exceptional potential.\n7 | My clan chief killed one of my parents, who had challenged the chief for leadership of the clan. Some combination of resentment and remorse stirs the clan chief to help me sometimes.\n8 | I made a strong impression on Borborygmos.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | An Azorius arrester thinks I can be reformed.\n2 | A Boros soldier gives me gifts in exchange for information about other clans' movements.\n3 | I once caught and released a Dimir spy.\n4 | I consult with a Golgari shaman for spiritual guidance at times.\n5 | Roll an additional Gruul contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n6 | An Izzet scientist blames the Gruul for the destruction of his life's work in a raid, but seems to think that I'm not like other Gruul.\n7 | I foolishly borrowed money from an Orzhov syndic to indulge a shameful vice.\n8 | A close friend left our clan and joined the Cult of Rakdos.\n9 | A distant relative is trying to recruit me into the Selesnya Conclave.\n10 | I stopped a Simic biomancer from trapping wild beasts to perform vile experiments on them.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nIn service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in your own way.\n\nYou will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.\n\nSometimes your objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.",

Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.\n\nGuilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.\n\nYou must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.\n\n\n### Specialty\n\n\nGuilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.\n\nd20 | Guild Business\n--- | ---\n1 | Alchemists and apothecaries\n2 | Armorers, locksmiths, and finesmiths\n3 | Brewers, distillers, and vintners\n4 | Calligraphers, scribes, and scriveners\n5 | Carpenters, roofers, and plasterers\n6 | Cartographers, surveyors, and chart-makers\n7 | Cobblers and shoemakers\n8 | Cooks and bakers\n9 | Glassblowers and glaziers\n10 | Jewelers and gemcutters\n11 | Leatherworkers, skinners, and tanners\n12 | Masons and stonecutters\n13 | Painters, limners, and sign-makers\n14 | Potters and tile-makers\n15 | Shipwrights and sail-makers\n16 | Smiths and metal-forgers\n17 | Tinkers, pewterers, and casters\n18 | Wagon-makers and wheelwrights\n19 | Weavers and dyers\n20 | Woodcarvers, coopers, and bowyers\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nGuild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it—I'm a perfectionist.\n2 | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.\n3 | I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.\n4 | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion.\n5 | I'm rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play.\n6 | I like to talk at length about my profession.\n7 | I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.\n8 | I'm well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I'm always taken aback when people haven't heard of me.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful)\n2 | Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)\n3 | Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)\n4 | Greed. I'm only in it for the money. (Evil)\n5 | People. I'm committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral)\n6 | Aspiration. I work hard to be the best there is at my craft. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.\n2 | I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy.\n3 | I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.\n4 | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love.\n5 | One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.\n6 | I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless.\n2 | I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.\n3 | No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers.\n4 | I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more.\n5 | I would kill to acquire a noble title.\n6 | I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork.

You have spent countless days rowing in the waters in and around Mulmaster and know them and the other fisherfolk, dockworkers, and port inhabitants better than anyone. Though you have left that life behind, you still visit once in a while.\n\n\n### Feature: Harborfolk\n\n\nYou grew up on the docks and waters of Mulmaster Harbor. The harborfolk remember you and still treat you as one of them. They welcome you and your companions. While they might charge you for it, they'll always offer what food and shelter they have; they'll even hide you if the City Watch is after you (but not if the Hawks are). Note: This feature is a variant of the Folk Hero feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I am curious. I want to know why things are the way they are and why people do the things that they do.\n2 | I can't sing, but that never stops me from doing it, loudly. Everyone loves a good sea chanty!\n3 | I think the High Blade is doing a terrific job, don't you?\n4 | I'm very excited that the House Built on Gold is being restored. I am a zealous worshipper of Waukeen.\n5 | I am quite superstitious. I see portents in everyday occurrences.\n6 | I resent the rich and enjoy thwarting their plans and spoiling their fun in small ways.\n7 | I have a sea story to fit every occasion.\n8 | I'm a fisher, but I secretly detest eating fish. I will do anything to avoid it.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Calm. For all things, there is a tide. I set sail when it is right, and mend my nets when it is not. (Lawful)\n2 | Windblown. I go where the winds blow. No man or woman tells me where or when to sail. (Chaotic)\n3 | Aspiring. I will gain the favor of a Zor or Zora patron, maybe even one of the Blades! (Any)\n4 | Salty. I want people to look to me as an expert on plying Mulmaster Harbor. (Any)\n5 | Selfless. We are all children of the sea. I help everyone in peril afloat and ashore. (Good)\n6 | Let them Drown. I refuse to risk my hide to help others. They wouldn't help me if roles were reversed. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I once lost everything but my rowboat. I'll do anything to protect it.\n2 | My brother was in the Soldiery, but he was killed. I really look up to the men and women who serve.\n3 | The Cloaks killed my friend for spellcasting. I'll get them back somehow, someday.\n4 | The High House of Hurting helped me when I was hurt and asked nothing in return. I owe them my life.\n5 | I was robbed in the Zhent ghetto once. It will not happen again.\n6 | I would do anything to protect the other harborfolk. They are my family.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I drink too much, which causes me to miss the tide.\n2 | I killed a drunk member of the City Watch in a brawl. I am terrified that they might find out.\n3 | I oversell myself and make promises I can't keep when I want to impress someone.\n4 | Book learning is a waste of time. I have no patience for people who don't speak from experience.\n5 | I almost always cheat. I can't help myself.\n6 | I am a secret informant for the Hawks. I send them reports about everything I see and hear, even what my friends and allies are up to.",

You don't know what it wants, and it won't leave you alone.\n4 | Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror.\n5 | An oni took your sibling one cold, dark night, and you were unable to stop it.\n6 | You were cursed with lycanthropy and later cured. You are now haunted by the innocents you slaughtered.\n7 | A hag kidnapped and raised you. You escaped, but the hag still has a magical hold over you and fills your mind with evil thoughts.\n8 | You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and images are burned into your psyche.\n9 | A fiend possessed you as a child. You were locked away but escaped. The fiend is still inside you, but now you try to keep it bottled up.\n10 | You did terrible things to avenge the murder of someone you loved. You became a monster, and it haunts your waking dreams.\n\nCharacters in a horror-focused campaign might have distinct motivations and characteristics.

No door remains unopened in my presence.\n5 | I let people underestimate me, revealing my full competency only to those close to me.\n6 | I compulsively seek to collect trophies of my travels and victories.\n7 | It doesn't matter if the whole world's against me.

I've wronged someone and must work their will to avoid their curse.\n4 | Escape. I believe there is something beyond the world I know, and I need to find it.\n5 | Legacy. I must do something great so that I'm remembered, and my time is running out.\n6 | Misdirection. I work vigorously to keep others from realizing my flaws or misdeeds.\n7 | Obsession.

The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.\n\nWork with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.\n\n\n### Specialty\n\n\nWhat was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.\n\nd8 | Life of Seclusion\n--- | ---\n1 | I was searching for spiritual enlightenment.\n2 | I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order.\n3 | I was exiled for a crime I didn't commit.\n4 | I retreated from society after a life-altering event.\n5 | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.\n6 | I needed to commune with nature, far from civilization.\n7 | I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic.\n8 | I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nSome hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.\n2 | I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.\n3 | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.\n4 | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.\n5 | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.\n6 | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.\n7 | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.\n8 | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Greater Good.

Your family operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, or owned a ship and has trade contacts throughout the Moonsea region, as well as up and down the length of the Sword Coast. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into the City of Trade, or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or Dragon's Breath, a brandy-like liquor. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.\n\nChoose one of the following features:\n\n\n### Feature: Factor\n\n\nAlthough you've left the day-to-day life of a merchant behind, your family has assigned you the services of a loyal retainer from the business, a factor, husbanding agent, seafarer, caravan guard, or clerk. This individual is a commoner who can perform mundane tasks for you such as making purchases, delivering messages, and running errands. He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the family assigns you another within a few days. Note: This feature is a variant of the Noble Knight's Retainers feature.\n\n\n### Alternate Feature: Trade Contact\n\n\nYou and your family have trade contacts such as caravan masters, shopkeepers, sailors, artisans, and farmers throughout the Moonsea region and all along the Sword Coast. Once per game session, when adventuring in either of those areas, you can use those contacts to get information about the local area or to pass a message to someone in those areas, even across the great distance between the two areas. Note: This feature is a variant of the Criminal Contact and Researcher features.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I fill my evenings with wine or mead and song.\n2 | I greatly admire gladiators and enjoy the Arena.\n3 | I take my wealth for granted. It seldom occurs to me that others aren't rich themselves.\n4 | I leave broken hearts all around the Moonsea and up and down the Sword Coast.\n5 | I work hard and seldom make time for fun.\n6 | I am a particularly devout and pray often.\n7 | The Red Plumes caught me once.

However, the Great Law of Trade only protects \"legitimate\" trade, trade that passes through the city's sole gate, which the Red Plumes monitor and tax. And the Great Law of Humanity banishes non-humans from the city altogether. The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.\n\nPerhaps you trafficked Dragon's Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non-humans and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price.\n\n\n### Feature: Secret Passage\n\n\nYou can call on your contacts within the smuggling community to secure secret passage into or out of Hillsfar for yourself and your adventuring companions, no questions asked, and no Red Plume entanglements. Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain they will be able to help on your timetable or at all. Your Dungeon Master will determine whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city. In return for your passage, you and your companions may owe the Rouges Guild a favor and/or may have to pay bribes. Note: This feature is a variant of the Sailor feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | When I'm not smuggling, I gamble.\n2 | I just love Halfling cooking and baking!\n3 | I party with dwarves whenever I can.\n4 | I'm a terrible singer, but I love to do it.\n5 | I was raised to honor Chauntea and still do.\n6 | The blood sports of the Arena sicken me.\n7 | I think non-humans are really interesting.\n8 | I exaggerate the tales of my exploits.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Fair. I think everyone deserves to be treated fairly. I don't play favorites. (Lawful)\n2 | Impulsive. Planning is often a waste of time. No plan survives contact with reality. It's easier to dive in and deal with the consequences. (Chaotic)\n3 | Curious. I want to learn as much as I can about the people and places I encounter. (Any)\n4 | Prepared. I think success depends on preparing as much as possible in advance. (Any)\n5 | Respectful. I think everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, creed, color, or origin. (Good)\n6 | Corrupt. I will break the law or act dishonestly if the money is right. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I am loyal to the Rogues Guild and would do anything for them.\n2 | I love the city of Hillsfar and my fellow Hillsfarians, despite the recent problems.\n3 | I admire the elves. I help them whenever I can.\n4 | A gnome helped me once. I pay the favor forward.\n5 | I enjoy tricking the Red Plumes at every opportunity.\n6 | I smuggled agricultural goods for non-human farmers. I try to help them when I can.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | My hatred for the Red Plumes burns so brightly that I have difficulty suppressing It around them.\n2 | The Red Plumes caught me once before, and I was branded for my crime.

I am disgusted with their failure to revolt against the Great Law of Humanity.\n4 | I have difficulty trusting strangers. Anyone could be a spy for the authorities.\n5 | I am greedy.

If you have completed any trials before the start of the campaign, you also have any cartouches you have earned\n\n\n### Feature: Trials of the Five Gods\n\n\nYour life is oriented around your participation in the five trials that will determine your worthiness in the afterlife. While you prepare for and undergo those trials, you have constant access to training. A comfortable place to live and regular meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal norms of Naktamun—training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter. See \"Trials of the Five Gods\" for more information about undertaking the trials and their rewards.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nAn initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight—the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I always have a joke on hand when the mood gets too serious.\n2 | I use sarcasm and insults to keep a distance between myself and my crop-mates, because I don't want to get attached to them.\n3 | I'll settle for nothing less than perfection—in myself, in my cropmates, in everything.\n4 | I'm so focused on the glorious afterlife that nothing in this life can shake my calm resolve.\n5 | I enjoy using my skills to help those who lack those same skills.\n6 | I train hard so that I can play hard at the end of the day. I fully expect to play even harder in the glorious afterlife, but I'm not in a hurry to get there.\n7 | I'm perfectly happy letting others pick up the slack for me while I take it easy.\n8 | I'm constantly sizing up everyone around me, thinking about what kind of opponent they'll be in the final trial.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Solidarity. The thing that matters most of all is that we're there for each other. (Lawful)\n2 | Knowledge. The world is a puzzle—a mystery waiting to be solved. (Neutral)\n3 | Strength. All that matters to me is my own perfection. Let everyone else seek that perfection in their own way. (Any)\n4 | Ambition. I'm going to prove that I deserve only the best—of everything. (Evil)\n5 | Zeal. Anything worth doing is worth throwing my whole self into. (Any)\n6 | Redemption. I will train all the harder to make up for the doubt I entertained when I was younger. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | One of my crop-mates is my dearest friend, and I hope we will face each other in the final trial.\n2 | I am in love with a vizier.\n3 | I am particularly drawn to one of the five gods, and I want nothing more than to win that god's particular favor.\n4 | I am more devoted to Naktamun and its people than I am to any of the ideals of the gods.\n5 | My weapon was a gift from a beloved trainer who died in an accident.\n6 | I carry a memento of my time as an acolyte, and I treasure it above all other things.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm easily distracted by an attractive person, which could be the death of me in the trials.\n2 | I really wanted to be a vizier, and I'm angry at the god who didn't choose me.\n3 | Training for a lifetime to die in the end seems like a big waste of energy.\n4 | I'm not at all sure I'll be able to grant a glorified death to any of my crop-mates.\n5 | I have a lasting grudge against one of my crop-mates, and each of us wants to see the other fail.\n6 | I think I've figured out that this world is not what it seems.

Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.\n\n\n### Path to Mystery\n\n\nYour first case influenced the types of mysteries you're interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose details from the First Case table to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator.\n\nd8 | Case\n--- | ---\n1 | A friend was wrongfully accused of murder. You tracked down the actual killer, proving your friend's innocence and starting your career as a detective.\n2 | You're told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you.\n3 | You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest.\n4 | You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you've continued to uncover magical hoaxes.\n5 | You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law.\n6 | You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm.\n7 | You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You're still trying to prove what you know is true.\n8 | You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can't solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay.\n\nCharacters in a horror-focused campaign might have distinct motivations and characteristics. Use the following tables to supplement your background's suggested characteristics or to inspire those of your own design.\n\nd12 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I had an encounter that I believe gives me a special affinity with a supernatural creature or event.\n2 | A signature piece of clothing or distinct weapon serves as an emblem of who I am.\n3 | I never accept that I'm out of my depth.\n4 | I must know the answer to every secret. No door remains unopened in my presence.\n5 | I let people underestimate me, revealing my full competency only to those close to me.\n6 | I compulsively seek to collect trophies of my travels and victories.\n7 | It doesn't matter if the whole world's against me. I'll always do what I think is right.\n8 | I have morbid interests and a macabre aesthetic.\n9 | I have a personal ritual, mantra, or relaxation method I use to deal with stress.\n10 | Nothing is more important than life, and I never leave anyone in danger.\n11 | I'm quick to jump to extreme solutions. Why risk a lesser option not working?\n12 | I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward.\n\nd12 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Adrenaline. I've experienced such strangeness that now I feel alive only in extreme situations.\n2 | Balance. I strive to counter the deeds of someone for whom I feel responsible.\n3 | Bound. I've wronged someone and must work their will to avoid their curse.\n4 | Escape. I believe there is something beyond the world I know, and I need to find it.\n5 | Legacy. I must do something great so that I'm remembered, and my time is running out.\n6 | Misdirection. I work vigorously to keep others from realizing my flaws or misdeeds.\n7 | Obsession. I've lived this way for so long that I can't imagine another way.\n8 | Obligation. I owe it to my people, faith, family, or teacher to continue a vaunted legacy.\n9 | Promise. My life is no longer my own. I must fulfill the dream of someone who's gone.\n10 | Revelation. I need to know what lies beyond the mysteries of death, the world, or the Mists.\n11 | Sanctuary. I know the forces at work in the world and strive to create islands apart from them.\n12 | Truth. I care about the truth above all else, even if it doesn't benefit anyone.\n\nd12 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I desperately need to get back to someone or someplace, but I lost them in the Mists.\n2 | Everything I do is in the service of a powerful master, one I must keep a secret from everyone.\n3 | I owe much to my vanished mentor. I seek to continue their work even as I search to find them.\n4 | I've seen great darkness, and I'm committed to being a light against it—the light of all lights.\n5 | Someone I love has become a monster, murderer, or other threat. It's up to me to redeem them.\n6 | The world has been convinced of a terrible lie. It's up to me to reveal the truth.\n7 | I deeply miss someone and am quick to adopt people who remind me of them.\n8 | A great evil dwells within me. I will fight against it and the world's other evils for as long as I can.\n9 | I'm desperately seeking a cure to an affliction or a curse, either for someone close to me for myself.\n10 | Spirits are drawn to me. I do all I can to help them find peace.\n11 | I use my cunning mind to solve mysteries and find justice for those who've been wronged.\n12 | I lost someone I care about, but I still see them in guilty visions, recurring dreams, or as a spirit.\n\nd12 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I believe doom follows me and that anyone who gets close to me will face a tragic end.\n2 | I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could.\n3 | I'm especially superstitious and live life seeking to avoid bad luck, wicked spirits, or the Mists.\n4 | I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out.\n5 | I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately.\n6 | I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits.\n7 | I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end.\n8 | I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice.\n9 | I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there.\n10 | I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies.\n11 | I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows.\n12 | I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals.",

Your time as an erstwhile bandit has given you plenty of experience in the saddle and a knack for acquiring and appraising other people's mounts, pets, and vehicles among other things.

Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.\n\nYou have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.\n\n\n### Izzet Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp\n1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant\n2nd | heat metal, rope trick\n3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding\n4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke's resilient sphere\n5th | animate objects, conjure elemental\n\nYour spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.\n\nIf you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.\n\nThe chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMembers of the Izzet League embody some combination of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in varying proportions. Some are committed to academic pursuits, and others just like explosions.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?\n2 | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!\n3 | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.\n4 | I do what my gut tells me.\n5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.\n6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.\n7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.\n8 | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Creativity. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic)\n3 | Discovery. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any)\n4 | Science. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful)\n5 | Fun. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic)\n6 | Power. Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem.\n2 | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.\n3 | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.\n4 | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.\n5 | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.\n6 | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.\n2 | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.\n3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.\n4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.\n5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.\n6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe laboratories of the Izzet League are constantly starting up new projects and dissolving old ones, so it's easy for even the lowliest attendant to make friends (and enemies) in laboratories across Ravnica.\n\nRoll twice on the Izzet Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Izzet Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | An older relative is a member of the guild's board of directors.\n2 | I know a sprite who carries important messages among the guild's laboratories.\n3 | A sibling is the head of a laboratory doing exotic research.\n4 | A former colleague is now an attendant in a laboratory in the central guildhall.\n5 | I'm in regular communication with an instructor who set me on the course of my life and research.\n6 | I had a romance with a chemister working in the Blistercoils.\n7 | As an attendant, I had a fierce rivalry with another attendant for our supervisor's attention.\n8 | The guildmaster, Niv-Mizzet, took note of one of my experiments!\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | An Azorius inspector seems interested in my work.\n2 | I was ready to join the Boros before I decided on Izzet, and I sometimes still hear from the sergeant who tried to recruit me.\n3 | One of my former assistants turned out to be a Dimir spy. We're not on friendly terms anymore, but we have a habit of running into each other.\n4 | A Golgari assassin killed a bitter rival of mine, leaving me with conflicted feelings.\n5 | I helped a minor Gruul chieftain acquire an Izzet weapon.\n6 | Roll an additional Izzet contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n7 | An Orzhov banker financed my laboratory's current work and expects great returns.\n8 | I have a cousin in the Cult of Rakdos, and we get along quite well.\n9 | A former attendant from the same laboratory ran off to join the Selesnya, and we get into a big argument every time we run into each other.\n10 | I compare notes and techniques with a Simic scientist over lunch sometimes.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nWhatever your role in the Izzet League, you are expected to contribute to its research in some way. That contribution might involve participating in tests, whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You might be one of the soldiers who protects a laboratory, or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equipment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.",

(If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\n1st | Comprehend Languages, Identify\n2nd | Borrowed Knowledge, Locate Object\n3rd | Speak with Dead, Spirit Guardians\n4th | Arcane Eye, Stone Shape\n5th | Flame Strike, Legend Lore\n\nConsider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Lorehold spells might create displays of golden light. You might use a tome or a scroll as a spellcasting focus, and your spell effects might reflect the appearance of the reference books you study.\n\n\n### Building a Lorehold Character\n\n\nAny class or subclass that deals with knowledge of the past can be a good fit in Lorehold. Bards thrive in Lorehold, and wizards (particularly those of the Wizard) are numerous among its students. Clerics (often with the Cleric or Cleric domains) are also quite common.\n\nFor a more unusual take on a Lorehold student, you could consider playing a barbarian with a primal connection to the past (perhaps adopting the Barbarian from Xanathar's Guide to Everything) or a paladin whose Paladin gives a concrete link to history.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMethodical historians and daring adventurers alike can be found among the ranks of Lorehold college. The Lorehold Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.\n2 | By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.\n3 | I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!\n4 | The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.\n5 | I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess.\n6 | In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.\n\n\n### Lorehold Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you may roll once on the Lorehold Trinket table, instead of on the trinket in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.",

Whenever you're on Lyceum grounds or at another major academic institution, you can requisition any set of tools found in the fifth edition rules. Each set of tools is magically marked to sound an alarm if they are removed from the university's grounds.\n\nWhen you seek services such as spellcasting from an NPC at the Alabaster Lyceum or a related institution, you can use those services at a 25 percent discount, at the GM's discretion.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe Alabaster Lyceum accepts students of all major trades, the fine arts, and the magical arts. Pupils talented and privileged enough to be accepted travel to Emon from all over Tal'Dorei, seeking to study among some of the greatest minds and most talented arcanists in the land. If you came from a smaller city, a rural area, or Tal'Dorei's relatively uncharted wilderness, studying at the Lyceum might have left you with a sense of culture shock, for good or for ill.\n\nYour bond is likely associated with your goals as a student or graduate. Your ideal probably involves your hopes in using the knowledge you've gained at the Lyceum, and your travels as an adventurer, to tailor the world to your liking.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I can't believe I'm here! At the Alabaster Lyceum. Oh, gods, I've dreamed of this my whole life, and now I'm here!\n2 | I can't believe I squandered all the opportunities I had at school. I was supposed to be learning good stuff, but I wasted it all daydreaming about fighting monsters.\n3 | Every night at school, I'd knock back a couple of meads and read with my pals! Just a bunch of nerds having fun, and I loved it.\n4 | Everyone at school was such a stick in the mud. Dressing the same, listening to the same bards...ugh, it's sad. Just be yourself.\n5 | I'm happiest when I've got my little party with me. At school, it was like we were a squad of heroes, slaying projects like monsters.\n6 | I'd really rather you didn't bother me. Can't you see I'm studying here?\n7 | I don't care. I just don't care about it all. The dates I had to memorize, the formulae I learned...I just want to run away and live!\n8 | I'm just...tired. All the time. Oh, adventuring, sure, that's fine, as long as I can find time to...nap...goodnight.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Preparedness. I can't go out into the world unless I know what I'm up against. Study first, act later. (Neutral)\n2 | Stardom. Having a team is good and all, but you can't win a game of ball without the star charger, and you know that's me. (Evil)\n3 | Individuality. The world keeps us down by trying to put us all into little boxes. I'm tired of living in my box, and I don't care what you think about it. (Chaotic)\n4 | Purpose. I study because there are things I need to know. I'll find my place in the world, and I'll make the world better. (Good)\n5 | Code of Conduct. The student code is there to benefit all students, you know. It's the same for laws! (Lawful)\n6 | Recreation. All this studying crap wasn't worth anything if you weren't partying when you were done. Meet me down at the tavern, okay? (Chaotic)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I came to the Lyceum with no one, but I fell in love with the city of Emon. I've finally found a place that feels like home!\n2 | Most of my professors drove me to frustration, but there's one who was kind and wise. I know they'll always have my back.\n3 | My family saved every copper piece to give me the opportunities I have now. I can't let them down.\n4 | I came to the Lyceum with a childhood friend, but we've long been drifting apart.\n5 | Discovery is the only thing that matters to me. The topic doesn't matter. Books keep me company on my loneliest days.\n6 | The Lyceum is my life. I'd give up anything—everything—to protect it from harm.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | The Lyceum taught me to never want to leave my room. The campus was so huge, and the crowds were so horrible.\n2 | You think you're so great just because you've got muscles, and endurance, and...shut up! Read a book sometime!\n3 | Huh? What? Sorry, I was thinking about a test I need to retake when I get back to school....\n4 | I spent too much time studying. Now I don't have any friends.\n5 | If you don't match my aesthetic, I'm not interested in you. We can work together, but we won't be friends. Got it?\n6 | I'm always striving for perfection. I got top of my class, sure, but only with a 98 average. And that's. Not. Perfect.",

Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.\n\n\n### Hardship Endured\n\n\nHardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.\n\nd6 | Hardship\n--- | ---\n1 | Nearly Drowned. You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence.\n2 | Captured. You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.\n3 | Sacrifice. You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you're dead.\n4 | Juggernaut. No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory.\n5 | Stowaway. For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.\n6 | Leave None Behind. You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMarines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I speak rarely but mean every word I say.\n2 | I laugh loudly and see the humor in stressful situations.\n3 | I prefer to solve problems without violence, but I finish fights decisively.\n4 | I enjoy being out in nature; poor weather never sours my mood.\n5 | I am dependable.\n6 | I am always working on some project or other.\n7 | I become cantankerous and quiet in the rain.\n8 | When the sea is within my sight, my mood is jovial and optimistic.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Teamwork. Success depends on cooperation and communication. (Good)\n2 | Code. The marines' code provides a solution for every problem, and following it is imperative. (Lawful)\n3 | Embracing. Life is messy. Throwing yourself into the worst of it is necessary to get the job done. (Chaotic)\n4 | Might. The strong train so that they might rule those who are weak. (Evil)\n5 | Bravery. To act when others quake in fear—this is the essence of the warrior. (Any)\n6 | Perseverance. No injury or obstacle can turn me from my goal. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I face danger and evil to offset an unredeemable act in my past.\n2 | I. Will. Finish. The. Job.\n3 | I must set an example of hope for those who have given up.\n4 | I'm searching for a fellow marine captured by an elusive enemy.\n5 | Fear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated.\n6 | My commander betrayed my unit, and I will have revenge.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I grow combative and unpredictable when I drink.\n2 | I find civilian life difficult and struggle to say the right thing in social situations.\n3 | My intensity can drive others away.\n4 | I hold grudges and have difficulty forgiving others.\n5 | I become irrational when innocent people are hurt.\n6 | I sometimes stay up all night listening to the ghosts of my fallen enemies.",

Your fur-trimmed robes and training in the visual and performing arts mark you as wealthy and perhaps well-born; you are a member of the City of Danger's aristocracy. None of your immediate family members sits on the Council of Blades or is even a Zor or Zora...yet. Nevertheless, you are one of Mulmaster's elite, and whether you personally covet a higher standing or not, you are at home in the dance halls where the aristocracy gathers to plot, to scheme, to do business, to discuss the arts, and, above all, to see, and to be seen.\n\n\n### Feature: Highborn\n\n\nMulmaster is run by and for its aristocracy. Every other class of citizen in the city defers to you, and even the priesthood, Soldiery, Hawks, and Cloaks treat you with deference. Other aristocrats and nobles accept you in their circles and likely know you or of you. Your connections can get you the ear of a Zor or Zora under the right circumstances.

I can find it in even the homeliest person and the most horrible tragedy.\n4 | Decorum must be preserved at all costs.\n5 | I will not admit I am wrong if I can avoid it.\n6 | I am extremely well-educated and frequently remind others of that fact.\n7 | I take what I can today, because I do not know what tomorrow holds.\n8 | My life is full of dance, song, drink, and love.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Generous. I have a responsibility to help and protect the less fortunate. (Good)\n2 | Loyal. My word, once given, is my bond. (Lawful)\n3 | Callous. I am unconcerned with any negative effects my actions may have on the lives and fortunes of others. (Evil)\n4 | Impulsive. I follow my heart. (Chaotic)\n5 | Ignorant. Explanations bore me. (Neutral)\n6 | Isolationist. I am concerned with the fortunes of my friends and family. Others must see to themselves. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I have dedicated my wealth and my talents to the service of one of the city's many temples.\n2 | My family and I are loyal supporters of High Blade Jaseen Drakehorn. Our fortunes are inexorably tied to hers. I would do anything to support her.\n3 | Like many families who were close to High Blade Selfaril Uoumdolphin, mine has suffered greatly since his fall. We honor his memory in secret.\n4 | My family plotted with Rassendyll Uoumdolphin brother usurped brother as High Blade. Betrayal is the quickest route to power.\n5 | Wealth and power are nothing. Fulfillment can only be found in artistic expression.\n6 | It's not how you feel, who you know, or what you can do - it's how you look, and I look fabulous.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have difficulty caring about anyone or anything other than myself.\n2 | Having grown up with wealth, I am careless with my finances. I overspend and am overly generous.\n3 | The ends (my advancement) justify any means.\n4 | I must have what I want and will brook no delay.\n5 | My family has lost everything. I must keep up appearances, lest we become a laughingstock.\n6 | I have no artistic sense. I hide that fact behind extreme opinions and have become a trendsetter.",

You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nNobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.\n2 | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.\n3 | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.\n4 | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.\n5 | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.\n6 | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.\n7 | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.\n8 | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good)\n2 | Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)\n3 | Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without coddling from my family. (Chaotic)\n4 | Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil)\n5 | Family. Blood runs thicker than water. (Any)\n6 | Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I will face any challenge to win the approval of my family.\n2 | My house's alliance with another noble family must be sustained at all costs.\n3 | Nothing is more important than the other members of my family.\n4 | I am in love with the heir of a family that my family despises.\n5 | My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.\n6 | The common folk must see me as a hero of the people.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I secretly believe that everyone is beneath me.\n2 | I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever.\n3 | I too often hear veiled insults and threats in every word addressed to me, and I'm quick to anger.\n4 | I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures.\n5 | In fact, the world does revolve around me.\n6 | By my words and actions, I often bring shame to my family.",

For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.\n\n\n### Orzhov Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Orzhov Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | friends, guidance\n1st | command, illusory script\n2nd | enthrall, ray of enfeeblement, zone of truth\n3rd | bestow curse, speak with dead, spirit guardians\n4th | blight, death ward, Leomund's secret chest\n5th | geas\n\nYour magic tends to manifest as swirling shadows, brilliant light, or sometimes the momentary appearance of shadowy spirit forms. Your spells might draw the blood of your enemies, or even directly touch their souls.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMembers of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I am always willing to act in accordance with the financial incentive offered.\n2 | Debts are never meant to be forgiven.\n3 | I am accustomed to enjoying the finest pleasures money can buy.\n4 | No one could doubt that I am a cut above the masses of pitiful peasants that infest the city.\n5 | I can't stand to spend a zib more than necessary to purchase what I need.\n6 | I hate it when people try to make light of a serious situation.\n7 | I want to make sure everyone is aware of how wealthy, powerful, and important I am.\n8 | I can't think of anything to look forward to.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Wealth. I will do whatever it takes to become as rich as the oligarchs. (Evil)\n3 | Power. One day, I will be the one giving orders. (Evil)\n4 | Prestige. I want to be admired, respected, feared, or even hated for my position and wealth. (Evil)\n5 | Stability. The economy functions best when chaos is kept under control and everyone knows their place. (Lawful)\n6 | Eternity. I want to live forever—in the flesh as long as possible, and as a spirit afterward. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | The unbearable weight of my debt has driven me to desperation.\n2 | I'm duty-bound to obey the dictates of an ancestor on the Ghost Council.\n3 | I value my worldly goods more highly than my mortal life.\n4 | An oligarch publicly humiliated me, and I will exact revenge on that whole family.\n5 | My faith in the Obzedat never wavers.\n6 | I want to prove myself more worthy than an older sibling and thereby ensure that I inherit a greater share of my parents' wealth.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I hold a scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever—but could also earn me the favor of the Ghost Council.\n2 | I'm convinced that everyone I know is plotting against me.\n3 | I'll brave any risk if the monetary reward is great enough.\n4 | I am convinced that I am far more important than anyone else is willing to acknowledge.\n5 | I have little respect for anyone who isn't wealthy.\n6 | I'll take any opportunity to steal from wealthier people, even for worthless trinkets.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe Orzhov Syndicate operates according to a strict hierarchy built on a network of connections among old, wealthy families. Your family might provide important contacts, while your family's activities in crime, banking, or debt collection could tie you to members of other guilds.\n\nRoll twice on the Orzhov Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Orzhov Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | The spirit of an ancestor has taken an interest in me.\n2 | An older cousin has the ear of a powerful oligarch.\n3 | I know a knight who is responsible for collecting debts from powerful people.\n4 | A vampire pontiff tried to use me as a pawn in past schemes.\n5 | A silent spirit follows me around.\n6 | A sibling has keys to parts of Vizkopa Bank.\n7 | A giant thinks I'm adorable.\n8 | I regularly offer tribute to an angel, and the angel has been kind to me in turn.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | An Azorius arrester is always snooping into my family's business transactions.\n2 | A Boros paladin saved my life, to my everlasting shame.\n3 | I know a shopkeeper who is secretly a Dimir agent and tries to make sure that I keep that secret hidden.\n4 | I'm fascinated by the culture of the Golgari kraul, and I have formed a friendship with one of their death priests.\n5 | A Gruul druid hates me but would never dare to touch me.\n6 | I know an Izzet engineer who is desperate to pay off a debt accrued by a deceased relative.\n7 | Roll an additional Orzhov contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n8 | My childhood friend is now a Rakdos torturer. We still meet for drinks occasionally.\n9 | I have the key to a vault where a Selesnya druid is hiding an item of secret shame.\n10 | I was married to a Simic bioengineer.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nThe structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.\n\nFor most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.",

The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.\n2 | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.\n3 | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.\n4 | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.\n5 | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.\n6 | I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.\n7 | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.\n8 | I was, in fact, raised by wolves.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Change.

The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)\n6 | Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.\n2 | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.\n3 | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.\n4 | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.\n5 | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.\n6 | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.\n2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.\n3 | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.\n4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.\n5 | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.\n6 | Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves.

You were going about your everyday business when the green dragon's forces spilled out of the sewers and assailed your home. Many of Phlan's citizens, young and old alike, were captured, killed, or offered as tribute to the Maimed Virulence. You, yourself were one of those captured. But, either with the help of adventurers or through your own wits and sheer determination, you escaped.\n\nRather than flee the region, you've chosen to stay and fight. Finding refuge outside the town and the deadly thicket surrounding it, you strike out against the Tears of the Virulence and their monstrous allies. You've learned to survive in dire and desperate circumstances, with supplies running low and the arrival of reinforcements uncertain. You've grown accustomed to acting under the cover of night, dealing what blows you can to avenge the friends and family you lost within the currently occupied Phlan. You will drive Vorgansharax out, or you die trying.\n\n\n### Origin\n\n\nRemoved from your life as a townsperson, you've adapted to rough life in the wilds surrounding Phlan. The trade you practiced still influences your outlook, the manner in which you approach situations, and the way you contribute to the resistance movement against the Maimed Virulence. You can roll on the following table to determine what your occupation was before the fall, or choose one that best fits your character (select from either the general column or the specific column, but not both).\n\nd8 | Origin (General) | Origin (Specific)\n--- | --- | ---\n1 | Fisher | Stojanow River Worker\n2 | Hunter | Twilight Marsh Worker\n3 | Craftsperson | Mantor's Library Scribe\n4 | Priest/Priestess | Clergy of Ilmater\n5 | Cook | Laughing Goblin Server\n6 | City Watch | Black Fist Guard\n7 | Servant | House Sokol Retainer\n8 | Unskilled Laborer | Bay of Phlan Dockworker\n\n\n### Feature: Guerrilla\n\n\nYou've come to know the surrounding forests, streams, caves, and other natural features in which you can take refuge—or set up ambushes. You can quickly survey your environment for advantageous features. Additionally, you can scavenge around your natural surroundings to cobble together simple supplies (such as improvised torches, rope, patches of fabric, etc.) that are consumed after use. Note: This feature is a variant of the Outlander feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nYou have given up the life you knew as a citizen of Phlan. However, the Maimed Virulence's invasion resonates deep inside you. Perhaps you have a few friends or family members who were able to escape with you. Or, perhaps, everyone you held dear either perished or went missing during the fall. You may know of someone who is, against all odds, surviving within the thicket and you long to liberate them from a life of peril within the town.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | My patience knows no bounds, so long as my goal is in sight.\n2 | In life and in struggle, the ends justify my actions.\n3 | If you aren't helping me, you'd best at least stay out of my way.\n4 | I long for the life that was taken away from me.\n5 | Friends and family perished, tragically, before my eyes. I hope never to undergo that again.\n6 | Making the right choices in life are important to me. The choices I make might save not just my life, but the lives of others as well.\n7 | I can never allow my foes to get the drop on me.\n8 | Time is a precious resource that I must spend wisely.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Leadership. The oppressed need someone to inspire them to courageous acts. (Good)\n2 | Unpredictability. Keeping the enemy guessing and off-balance is my tactical strength. (Chaos)\n3 | Determination. Threats to my home must be eliminated at all costs. (Any)\n4 | Freedom. Those who are enslaved and unjustly imprisoned deserve my aid. (Good)\n5 | Resourcefulness. Our wits are our most valuable resource in troubled times. (Any)\n6 | Unity. Working together, we can overcome all obstacles, even the most seemingly insurmountable ones. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I'll never let my fellow insurgents down. They are my only remaining friends.\n2 | I was separated from a loved one during my escape from town. I will find them.\n3 | One of the Tears of the Virulence was a trusted friend, until the day they betrayed the city. They will pay harshly for their transgressions.\n4 | An item I hold close is my last remaining connection to the family I lost during the fall.\n5 | The dragon who took my past life away from me will feel the full extent of my vengeance.\n6 | The knowledge in Mantor's Library is an irreplaceable treasure that must be protected.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have no respect for those who flee. I harbor a deep grudge against the citizens who abandoned Phlan.\n2 | Ale is the only way I can escape the desperation of my circumstances.\n3 | It doesn't take much to get me into a fight.\n4 | Being an insurgent means doing things that aren't always ethical. I'm still learning to live with that.\n5 | My desire to liberate Phlan oftentimes clouds my judgment, despite my best efforts.\n6 | I relentlessly despise the Maimed Virulence and his allies. I'd abandon other goals in order to strike out at them.",

Everything has changed, and you are lucky to be alive. Back in Phlan you could count yourself among those street-wise folks who knew when to pay a bribe and who to work with to make a living. Your ability to listen to the winds of change have saved you before, and this time they allowed you to be one of the lucky few who escaped Phlan with something more than just the shirt on your back.\n\n\n### Feature: Phlan Survivor\n\n\nWhatever your prior standing was, you are now one of the many refugees that have come to Mulmaster. You are able to find refuge with others from Phlan and those who sympathize with your plight. Within Mulmaster this means that you can find a place to bed down, recover, and hide from the watch with either other refugees from Phlan, or the Zhents within the ghettos. Note: This feature is a variant of the Folk Hero feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I may have lost everything I worked for most of my life, but there's work to be done, no time to linger on the past.\n2 | I worked hard to get where I am and I refuse to let a little hardship stop me from succeeding.\n3 | I protect those around me, you never know when one of them will be useful.\n4 | I have always gotten ahead by giving, why change now?\n5 | I prepare for everything, it paid off in Phlan and it will pay off again.\n6 | I will reclaim my home, though the path may be long, I will never give up hope.\n7 | I never cared for personal hygiene, and am amazed that It bothers others.\n8 | I am always willing to volunteer my services, just as long as don't have to do anything.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Justice. Corruption brought Phlan down, I will not tolerate that any longer. (Lawful)\n2 | Acceptance. Stability is a myth, to think you can control your future is futile. (Chaotic)\n3 | Hope. I am guided by a higher power and I trust that everything will be right in the end. (Good)\n4 | Restraint. I hate those who caused my loss. It is all I can do not to lash out at them. (Any)\n5 | Strength. As shown in Phlan, the strong survive. If you are weak you deserve what you get (Evil)\n6 | Openness. I am always willing to share my life story with anyone who will listen. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I have the chance at a new life and this time I am going to do things right.\n2 | The Lord Regent brought this suffering upon his people. I will see him brought to justice.\n3 | I await the day I will be able to return to my home in Phlan.\n4 | I will never forget the debt owed to Glevith of the Welcomers. I will be ready to repay that debt when called upon.\n5 | There was someone I cared about in Phlan, I will find out what happened to them.\n6 | Some say my life wasn't worth saving, I will prove them wrong.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I used the lives of children to facilitate my escape from Phlan.\n2 | I am a sucker for the underdog, and always bet on the loosing team.\n3 | I am incapable of standing up for myself.\n4 | I will borrow money from friends with no intention to repay it.\n5 | I am unable to keep secrets. A secret is just an untold story.\n6 | When something goes wrong, it's never my fault.",

Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like ex injuria jus non oritur and cogitationis poenam nemo patitur to frighten people into thinking you know what you're talking about. With common folks who don't know any better, you might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nPlaintiffs come in many varieties. Some are innocent bystanders who want only fair compensation for their injuries. Others are professional courtroom operatives, going to extreme lengths to appear wronged in pursuit of a large payout.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I can't believe I have a chance to join Acquisitions Incorporated! The fun I'm going to have!\n2 | I've been wronged my entire life, and the world owes me.\n3 | I have always tried to make the best of a bad situation.\n4 | The law doesn't protect the honest and the hard working. I'm going to do whatever needs to be done to make things right.\n5 | I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n6 | My superiors are smarter and wiser than I am. I do what I'm told.\n7 | Never pass up the opportunity to make an easy bit of coin. That's my motto.\n8 | I'm beginning to feel like the gods are not on my side.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Justice. Those who break the law need to answer for their crimes. (Lawful)\n2 | Freedom. People must have the freedom to do what they want and pursue their dreams. (Chaotic)\n3 | Greed. Everyone I see is getting theirs, so I'm surely going to get mine. (Evil)\n4 | Chaos. You're out of order! And you're out of order! This whole realm is out of order! (Chaotic)\n5 | Humility. I'm just a small part of a larger whole. So is everyone else. (Neutral)\n6 | Responsibility.

We have each other's backs.\n6 | My legal counsel is my best friend. I owe all my forthcoming opportunities to their hard work.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | The person who gains the most reward for the least effort wins.\n2 | Three magic beans for just one cow?

Your character might belong to one of these groups or another ideological faction, perhaps one of your own creation.\n\nThe primary factions of Sigil, which are further detailed in chapter 2, adhere to the following philosophies:\n\n- Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.\n- There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.\n- Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.\n- Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.\n- All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.\n- Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.\n- The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not.\n- Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.\n- Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.\n- The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.\n- Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.\n- Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.\n\n\n### Feature: Conviction\n\n\nYou gain the Scion of the Outer Planes feat. In addition, members of your organization provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their holdings or the homes of other faction members.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nAdventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy regarding the multiverse are welcomed among factions that embrace those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I don't venerate any gods. With time, we can be as powerful as them or greater.\n2 | Experience is everything; live in the moment.\n3 | When things crumble, I find meaning in the dust.\n4 | Life thrives through order, and I seek to maintain that order.\n5 | When others make plans, the multiverse laughs and so do I.\n6 | I know what's right, and none will stand in my way.\n\n\n### Building a Planar Philosopher Character\n\n\nSome groups of planar philosophers might prefer certain types of characters, but by and large any character who upholds and furthers the beliefs of such a group is welcome within its ranks.\n\n\n### Planar Philosopher Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you can roll once on the Planar Philosopher Trinket table, instead of on the Trinket table in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.",

You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.\n\n\n### Building a Prismari Character\n\n\nAny class or subclass that wields elemental forces of cold, fire, lightning, and wind can be a good fit in Prismari. Druids and sorcerers are common in Prismari, and wizards who study the Schools of Wizard or Wizard are also well represented. Clerics aren't very common in this school, but some with the Cleric end up here.\n\nBeyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Prismari students also include monks who follow the Monk. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Fighter) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThough the curriculum of Prismari College attracts many outgoing and driven artists, the school has no shortage of shy scholars and lackadaisical blowhards among its ranks. The Prismari Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm the life of the party, and I expect everyone's attention when I walk into a room.\n2 | Two weeks ago, I was enthralled with my latest project.

Nothing quite captures my attention anymore.\n6 | Instead of confronting my negative emotions, I channel them into explosive artistic displays.\n\n\n### Prismari Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you may roll once on the Prismari Trinket table, instead of on the trinket in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.",

Both the scholarly focus of wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Wizard, Wizard, or Wizard) and the metamagic manipulations of sorcerers are welcome in Quandrix, and many druids explore the patterns of nature in Quandrix as well. A few clerics, particularly those with the Cleric or Cleric domains, study in Quandrix as well.\n\nAside from traditional spellcasters, a few characters of other classes find homes in Quandrix. Some fighters, monks, rangers, and rogues study here, using Quandrix principles to train their minds.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nWith subjects ranging from the physical and tangible to the paradoxical and strange, the student body of Quandrix College includes an eclectic mix of individuals. The Quandrix Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | When I find a subject I'm interested in, I won't stop studying until I know everything about it.

(If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | fire bolt, vicious mockery\n1st | burning hands, dissonant whispers, hellish rebuke\n2nd | crown of madness, enthrall, flaming sphere\n3rd | fear, haste\n4th | confusion, wall of fire\n5th | dominate person\n\nYour magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent's mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target's face.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMembers of demonic cults aren't generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you're likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I revel in mayhem, the more destructive the better.\n2 | When violence breaks out, I lose myself in rage, and it's sometimes hard to stop.\n3 | Everything is funny to me, and the most hilarious and bloodiest things leave me cackling with sadistic glee.\n4 | I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others.\n5 | I enjoy testing other people's patience.\n6 | I can't stand it when things are predictable, so I like to add a little chaos to every situation.\n7 | I throw my weight around to make sure I get my way.\n8 | I enjoy breaking delicate works of art. And fingers, which are sort of the same.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Hedonism. Death comes for everyone, so take as much pleasure as you can from every moment of life. (Neutral)\n3 | Creativity. I strive to find more ways to express my art through pain—my own as well as others'. (Chaotic)\n4 | Freedom. No one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)\n5 | Equality. I want to see Ravnica remade, with no guilds and no hierarchies. (Chaotic)\n6 | Spectacle. People are inspired by the greatness they see in art. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I have belonged to the same performance troupe for years, and these people mean everything to me.\n2 | A blood witch told me I have a special destiny to fulfill, and I'm trying to figure out what it is.\n3 | I'm secretly hoping that I can change the cult from the inside, using my influence to help rein in the wanton violence.\n4 | I own something that Rakdos once touched (it's seared black at the spot), and I cherish it.\n5 | I want to be better at my chosen form of performance than any other member of my troupe.\n6 | I am devoted to Rakdos and live to impress him.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | My family is prominent in another guild. I enjoy my wild life, but I don't want to embarrass them.\n2 | I couldn't hide my emotions and opinions even if I wanted to.\n3 | I throw caution to the wind.\n4 | I resent the rich and powerful.\n5 | When I'm angry, I lash out in violence.\n6 | There's no such thing as too much pleasure.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe Cult of Rakdos is anything but organized. Individuals frequently move from one performance troupe to another. Almost all members of the cult know former castmates now in different troupes, which allows for the possibility of a widespread network of contacts.\n\nRoll twice on the Rakdos Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Rakdos Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | I was part of a two-person act until my former partner moved to a different troupe.\n2 | My sibling and I ran away from home and joined the Cult of Rakdos together. We're very close.\n3 | A childhood friend of mine is an attendant in Rix Maadi, the Rakdos guildhall.\n4 | My parents brought me into the guild and taught me my trade.\n5 | There's a lesser demon in the cult who thinks he owes me a favor, and who am I to argue?\n6 | The master of ceremonies in my troupe is well connected with other troupes.\n7 | I had a romance with a pain artist in another troupe.\n8 | Rakdos himself has witnessed me perform.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | I know an Azorius elocutor who has a very amusing dark side.\n2 | A Boros captain really wants to \"redeem\" me.\n3 | I think a member of my troupe is a Dimir agent.\n4 | I once convinced a Golgari medusa to participate in a show. We've been on good terms ever since.\n5 | I came from the Gruul and still have relatives there.\n6 | An Izzet technician provides pyrotechnics for my performances.\n7 | An Orzhov oligarch has taken an interest in my career, like a patron of the arts.\n8 | Roll an additional Rakdos contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n9 | A Selesnya healer attends my performances regularly.\n10 | A Simic biomancer provides mutant monsters to add a taste of the bizarre to our shows.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nThe Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.\n\nYou work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.",

Choose one of the Betrayer Gods. You have Advantage and Disadvantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to know information about their faith, including obscure secrets unknown to most worshipers.\n\nAdditionally, you can work with your GM to create a secret that you learned during your time in the cult. This secret might be the seed of a conspiracy, a myth of a legendary hero whose true meaning has mutated over the years, or even the location of a fabled artifact of the gods.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe life of every former cultist is defined to some degree by the process of fleeing the past, and of trying to make a future away from the beliefs that once claimed them. Your bond is likely associated with those who gave you the insight and strength to flee your old ways. Your ideal might involve your desire to take down and destroy those who promote the evil you escaped, and perhaps finding new faith in a forgiving god.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I need a dagger close at hand at all times. Just in case they find me.\n2 | I can't believe I'm out here fighting monsters. After everything I've been through, why can't I find a normal life?\n3 | I need a stiff drink before I do anything stressful these days. I know it's a problem. Just...let me have this.\n4 | Murder is okay when it's for a good cause! I didn't tear my past out by the roots so I could let evil people cause more harm.\n5 | My past is filled with stories like you wouldn't believe. Ones that'll really make your skin crawl. Do you want to hear...?\n6 | Yeah, I'm crying. I do that. Get over yourself.\n7 | I know you've told me your name twice already, but that's not good enough. How can I be sure you are who you say you are?\n8 | My mind is always racing. I can't...I just need to...you have to give me a second—or else I can't...organize my thoughts.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Life. I've spent too long shackled to an evil master. No matter what happened before, I deserve my freedom now. (Chaotic)\n2 | Redemption. People can change, but redemption must be something they choose for themselves. If they do, it is my duty to help them along that path. (Good)\n3 | Power. When I abandoned the cult, it wasn't out of some misguided sense of righteousness. That pathetic organization was merely a shackle on my potential. (Evil)\n4 | Vengeance. The cult has poisoned my life. I will see all its followers suffer. (Any)\n5 | Hierarchy. The cult was vile, but its strength was in stability and organization. As long as good folk lack unity, evil will always triumph. (Lawful)\n6 | Reparations. As a cultist, I harmed people whose names I'll never know. I feel obligated to repay my debt by aiding others. (Good)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My cousin escaped the cult with me. I lost track of them when we fled, but I know they're alive. I can feel it.\n2 | I was saved from the cult by a priest of one of the Prime Deities. If not for that sign of faith, I would surely be lost.\n3 | I was told by the person who saved me that a sage once said: \"Life needs things to live.\" I don't know what that means, but I've dedicated my existence to finding out.\n4 | One of my cultist parents had a change of heart when I was a teenager, and we fled together in the dark of night. I didn't want to leave, but I understand now that their courage saved my life.\n5 | I was bested by a warrior when I fumbled a cult-ordered assassination. I don't know why that person took pity on me, but they gave me purpose when I was lost.\n6 | Now that I've saved myself, the only person important to me is my former cult leader—because I've sworn that they'll die by my hand.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm haunted by what I saw in those ritual chambers. Every time I see blood, I...oh, gods, I can't bear to even think about it.\n2 | I ran from the cult long ago. But deep down, there's a part of me that still thinks they were right about certain things.\n3 | I can't help but feel a rush whenever I see a life snuffed out before me. Just one more kill... just one more.\n4 | Organized religion terrifies me. Betrayer Gods or Prime Deities...it doesn't matter. The sight of the faithful freezes my blood cold.\n5 | Oh, I always tell the truth. Always. I've never had to keep a secret from anyone, so of course I'll be open with you.\n6 | I don't trust easily.

You gain the Lucky, Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice). Your choice of feat reflects the transformation that changed your life. An encounter with a genie who gave you three wishes might have resulted in magical powers represented by Magic Initiate. If you paid off all your family debts with a fortuitous round of three-dragon ante, you might be Lucky instead. Alternatively, you could use the Skilled feat to reflect whatever trial you endured to secure your new destiny and to model the knowledge and abilities imparted to you by whatever force transformed your life.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nYour character's perspective on life has changed thanks to their new destiny. The Rewarded Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character and cards from the Deck of Many Things that might have prompted this trait.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | A safe home is a foundation on which anything else can be built. (Key, Throne)\n2 | I was elevated to heights I could never otherwise attain, and I won't waste my fortune. (Star, Sun)\n3 | I try to be a source of inspiration and joy to others. Life is never as bad as you think! (Euryale, Jester)\n4 | Courage and boldness can carry the day when all else fails. (Comet, Knight)\n5 | My good fortune means I can lift others up as well. (Gem, Moon)\n6 | Having the right answers is the first step to solving any problem, no matter how dire. (Fates, Sage)\n\n\n### Building a Rewarded Character\n\n\nRewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers.\n\nIf your character's life was changed by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you're making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card.\n\n\n### Rewarded Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you can roll once on the Rewarded Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.\n\nd6 | Trinket\n--- | ---\n1 | A perfumed silk scarf from an admirer\n2 | A crystal bead that glows like a candle in the dark\n3 | A letter of introduction and invitation from an influential person in a far-off city\n4 | A motto or symbol whose meaning eludes you, etched on a piece of your equipment\n5 | A crisp playing card that never seems to tear or soil, depicting the card that affected you\n6 | Half a medallion designed to be rejoined to its other half",

If you've kept your senses sharp for every opportunity and climbed your way out of misery by seizing the tiniest scrap of hope, choose Alert.

(Donjon, Void)\n\n\n### Building a Ruined Character\n\n\nRuined characters were on top of the world before misfortune struck. Many were wealthy. Others come from modest backgrounds, but they were surrounded by friends, family, and loved ones. They might have been famous, or simply never encountered serious hardship before. Some were born to privilege or rose to prominence through trickery or a false reputation. Now a Deck of Many Things—or another calamity—has knocked them down like a house of cards.\n\nIf your character's life was ruined by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps your character was imprisoned for years by the Donjon or Void card, and now everyone they knew has died. Maybe your character drew the Rogue card, and the person closest to them—a spouse, child, or parent—turned against them. A devil unleashed by the Flames card might have destroyed their life. The Ruin or Talons card might have stolen the character's material goods or saddled them with vast debt.\n\n\n### Ruined Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you can roll once on the Ruined Trinkets table instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook.\n\nd6 | Trinket\n--- | ---\n1 | A rusted scrap of a once-beloved family heirloom\n2 | A land deed, but all the names and markings that once tied it to you have faded into obscurity\n3 | A bauble once imbued with powerful magic\n4 | A battered playing card with a hole pierced in it, its face depicting the card that affected you\n5 | A yellowed Humanoid tooth that whispers eerily when placed under a pillow\n6 | A keepsake from someone you were once close to but who is now your enemy",

Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.

You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nSailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well.

The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good)\n2 | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)\n3 | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)\n4 | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)\n5 | People.

You do so by maintaining a secret identity, forging documents, and wearing a disguise. Few, if any, know you aren't human. If you're a halfling or gnome, you pass as a little person or a child. If you're a half-elf, half-orc, or genasi, you disguise your non-human features. Other races use a combination of disguise and concealing clothing to hide. Your reasons for doing so are your own. Perhaps you're a dissident or the agent of a foreign power. Maybe you have a relationship with someone you cannot bear to leave. Regardless, this way of life has taken a heavy toll on you.\n\n\n### Feature: Secret Identity\n\n\nYou have created a secret identity that you use to conceal your true race and that offers a covering explanation for your presence in Hillsfar. In addition, you can forge documents, including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy Note: This feature is a variant of the Charlatan feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | Despite its problems, I love Hillsfar, it's the greatest city in the world. The only one for me.\n2 | I move from place to place, never staying anywhere long and leaving nothing behind.\n3 | I think flattery is the best way to direct attention away from me.\n4 | I don't make friends easily. They're a liability I cannot afford.\n5 | Risk and danger are exhilarate me. Pulling off schemes and deceptions is a rush.\n6 | The First Lord is right, humans are superior. I really admire them, despite the atrocities.\n7 | I avoid people of my own race, as well as things associated with my race, lest they give me away.\n8 | I live for the Arena. I admire gladiators and enjoy the thrill of blood on the sands!\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Quisling. Supporting the rulers of the land and following the laws is the road to salvation. (Lawful)\n2 | Scoflaw. The laws and lawmakers are corrupt. I follow laws only when it suits me. (Chaotic)\n3 | Optimist. Everyone Is basically good. Though the government is misguided it will all be okay. (Any)\n4 | Secretive. I am in the habit of not talking about myself. My business is none of yours. (Any)\n5 | Heroic. I do everything I can to help non-humans, regardless of the personal cost to me. (Good)\n6 | Depraved. I have lost my moral compass. The ends justify most any means. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | The humans of Hillsfar have inflicted terrible harm on me, my family, and my race. I will have revenge.\n2 | I am part of an underground network that smuggles non-humans into and out of the city.\n3 | I am a partisan. I commit minor acts of defiance against the First Lord and Red Plumes when I can.\n4 | I am a spy. I report on events in and around Hillsfar.\n5 | My secret identity is the only thing protecting me from the Arena. I will stop at nothing to maintain it.\n6 | I am madly in love with a human who does not know my true identity, and I fear rejection if I reveal it.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | After years of denying who I am, I now despise myself and other members of my pathetic race.\n2 | Years of hiding have made me somewhat paranoid. I trust no one.\n3 | I've been lying so often and for so long that I can't help it anymore. I frequently lie for no reason at all.\n4 | I am ashamed. I failed to protect a member of my family who was seized and thrown into the Area.\n5 | I am struggling with maintaining my secret identity. I subconsciously want to get caught and therefore sometimes let my secret identity slip.\n6 | Years of successfully deceiving others have made me cocky. I think no one can see through my lies.",

You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort.\n\nIn addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.\n\n\n### Selesnya Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.

A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nMost members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers—the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful—unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I never raise my voice or lose my temper.\n2 | I feel the pains and joys of everyone around me, friend or foe.\n3 | I would rather make a friend than thwart an enemy.\n4 | I'm always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses.\n5 | I'm uneasy if I can't see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet.\n6 | Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me.\n7 | I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life.\n8 | Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Harmony. Nothing is more beautiful than voices and actions aligned in common purpose. (Good)\n3 | Order. Like a well-pruned tree, society thrives when everything is kept in good order. (Lawful)\n4 | Life. Preserving life and nature is always a worthwhile endeavor. (Good)\n5 | Humility. Ambition and pride are the roots of strife. (Good)\n6 | Evangelism. When all have joined the Selesnya Conclave, Ravnica will finally know peace. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first encountered Mat'Selesnya.\n2 | I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them.\n3 | A healer nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness.\n4 | I'll sing the invitation of Mat'Selesnya with my dying breath.\n5 | I cherish a leaf from Vitu-Ghazi that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree.\n6 | Every member of the conclave is my kin, and I would fight for any one of them.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered.\n2 | I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise.\n3 | I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort.\n4 | I have a fierce temper that doesn't reflect the inner calm I seek.\n5 | I'm convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to the Worldsoul than I do.\n6 | I'm trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya, but I find it hard to give up my bad habits.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe Selesnya Conclave is all about connections, so its members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw converts from other guilds, and often these new guild members maintain friendships with former guild mates.\n\nRoll twice on the Selesnya Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Selesnya Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | A wise centaur trainer believed in me even though I was a terrible student.\n2 | A good friend has risen to become a Ledev guardian.\n3 | I left my former guild and joined the Selesnya along with a close friend.\n4 | The dryad at the head of my enclave has taken an interest in my activities.\n5 | A sibling is an instructor at the guild's training grounds.\n6 | One of my parents is a votary, tasked with protecting the temple gardens at the Vitu-Ghazi guildhall.\n7 | I had a romance with a well-known Selesnya healer.\n8 | Trostani, the head of the guild and the voice of Mat'Selesnya, once welcomed me into her presence.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | I left the Azorius, and a former colleague still resents me for that act.\n2 | A good friend, eager for action, left the Selesnya and joined the Boros.\n3 | I had a relationship with a guild mate who turned out to be a Dimir agent.\n4 | I know a disgruntled Golgari assassin who is ripe for recruitment.\n5 | I'm friendly with a Gruul centaur who almost joined us a few years back.\n6 | I once had a heated public argument with an Izzet chemister, and neither of us is allowed back into that restaurant.\n7 | I paid off my debt to the Orzhov Syndicate, but my good friend was not so lucky and remains indebted to that guild.\n8 | At a time of terrible grief in my life, a Rakdos performer made a mockery of my pain, leaving me with mixed feelings of sadness and humor.\n9 | Roll an additional Selesnya contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n10 | I have a sibling in the Simic Combine, and we argue every time we see each other.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAlthough the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.\n\nThat said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions—or even expel you from the guild—if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.",

You recall sitting cross-legged hearing the stories of the glorious Thultanthar, also called the Shade Enclave and the City of Shade, and aspired to study there and maybe even did, for a time. Your dreams came crashing down a few years ago when Thultanthar fell from the sky upon Myth Drannor.\n\nYou know that there was a Netherese Garrison stationed near Hillsfar and have heard rumors that its downfall came from traitors within the ranks. You remain loyal to Netheril and seek other Shade loyalists and fanatics in the Cormanthor forest and the areas surrounding Hillsfar.\n\n\n### Feature: Secret Society\n\n\nYou have a special way of communicating with others who feel the same way you do about the Shade. When you enter a village or larger city you can identify contact who will give you information on those that would hinder your goals and those would help you simply because of your desire to see the Shade Enclave return in all its glory.

When you use this ability, you restore a number of hit points to the hull of a water vehicle equal to 5 × your proficiency modifier. A vehicle cannot be patched by you in this way again until after it has been pulled ashore and fully repaired.\n\n\n### Life at Sea\n\n\nYour life at sea and in port has shaped you; you can roll on the following table to determine its impact or choose an element that best fits your character.\n\nd6 | Sea's Influence\n--- | ---\n1 | Grand Designs. You are working on plans and schematics for a new, very fast ship. You must examine as many different kinds of vessels as possible to help ensure the success of your design.\n2 | Solid and Sound. You patched up a war galley and prevented it from sinking. The local navy regards you as a friend.\n3 | Favored. You insisted on thicker planking for a merchant vessel's hull, which saved it from sinking when it smashed against a reef. You have a standing invitation to visit the merchant's distant mansion.\n4 | Master of Armaments. You specialized in designing and mounting defenses for the navy. You easily recognize and determine the quality of such items.\n5 | Low Places. You have contacts in the smuggling outfits along the coast; you occasionally repair the criminals' ships in exchange for coin and favors.\n6 | Mysteries of the Deep. You experienced an encounter with a possibly divine being while sailing alone. Work with your DM to determine the secret about the deep waters of the sea that this entity revealed to you.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nShipwrights are resourceful carpenters and designers. They often have a dedicated spot at the local tavern, since shipwrights are invaluable to coastal communities. Some travel with naval fleets and might serve as officers if their temperament suits it. Shipwrights have an affinity for working with their hands and often perform feats of carpentry that others might deem miraculous.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen.\n2 | I'm extremely fond of puzzles.\n3 | I thrive under pressure.\n4 | I love sketching and designing objects, especially boats.\n5 | I'm not afraid of hard work—in fact, I prefer it.\n6 | A pipe, an ale, and the smell of the sea: paradise.\n7 | I have an endless supply of cautionary tales related to the sea.\n8 | I don't mind getting my hands dirty.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Crew. If everyone on deck pitches in, we'll never sink. (Good)\n2 | Careful Lines. A ship must be balanced according to the laws of the universe. (Lawful)\n3 | Invention. Make what you need out of whatever is at hand. (Chaotic)\n4 | Perfection. To measure a being and find it lacking is the greatest disappointment. (Evil)\n5 | Reflection. Muddied water always clears in time. (Any)\n6 | Hope. The horizon at sea holds the greatest promise. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I must visit all the oceans of the world and behold the ships that sail there.\n2 | Much of the treasure I claim will be used to enrich my community.\n3 | I must find a kind of wood rumored to possess magical qualities.\n4 | I repair broken things to redeem what's broken in myself.\n5 | I will craft a boat capable of sailing through the most dangerous of storms.\n6 | A kraken destroyed my masterpiece; its teeth shall adorn my hearth.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I don't know when to throw something away. You never know when it might be useful again.\n2 | I get frustrated to the point of distraction by shoddy craftsmanship.\n3 | Though I am an excellent crafter, my work tends to look as though it belongs on a ship.\n4 | I am so obsessed with sketching my ideas for elaborate inventions that I sometimes forget little thing like eating and sleeping.\n5 | I'm judgmental of those who are not skilled with tools of some kind.\n6 | I sometimes take things that don't belong to me, especially if they are very well made.",

Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light. Any auditory effects of your spells often sound like amplified echoes of your own voice speaking the spells' verbal components—even amid the crash of lightning or a fiery eruption.\n\n\n### Building a Silverquill Character\n\n\nMany bards find a home in Silverquill, putting the power of their voices to use with Silverquill magic. Wizards (especially those who study the Schools of Wizard and Wizard) are common in Silverquill, as are warlocks. Clerics with the Divine Domains of Cleric and Cleric also fit in well among the mages of Silverquill.\n\nA number of both paladins and rogues attend Silverquill College as well, highlighting the diversity of the student body.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nWith the college's intense standards looming over them, Silverquill students range from cocky and cutthroat to overwhelmed perfectionists. The Silverquill Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'll say whatever I need to in order to maintain my high social status.\n2 | I prefer saying the blunt truth over a pretty lie, and I don't particularly care whose feelings I hurt.\n3 | I believe that uplifting my peers is the best way to succeed.\n4 | I've mastered the art of using humor as a defense, and I always have a charming joke ready.\n5 | I always wait before speaking, analyzing the situation for whichever angle is most advantageous to my goals.\n6 | No one knows about the all-nighters I've pulled to keep my magic looking effortless, and I'm going to keep it that way.\n\n\n### Silverquill Trinkets\n\n\nWhen you make your character, you may roll once on the Silverquill Trinket table, instead of on the trinket in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.",

    "entries": "- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Medicine\n- **Languages:** Two of your choice\n- **Equipment:** A Simic insignia, a set of common clothes, a book of research notes, an ink pen, a Ink (1-ounce bottle), a oil (flask) (made from blubber), a acid (vial) (derived from digestive juices), a vial of fish scales, a vial of seaweed, a vial of jellyfish stingers, a glass bottle of unidentified slime, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)\n\n\n### Clades and Projects\n\n\nAs a Simic researcher, you are part of a clade—a diverse group of individuals combining disparate talents in pursuit of a common goal—or a researcher on a specialized, short-term project focused on addressing an immediate need. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the Research Options table to determine your area of research.\n\nd6 | Clade/Project\n--- | ---\n1 | Hull Clade, focused on protection and durability\n2 | Fin Clade, focused on movement\n3 | Gyre Clade, focused on cyclical patterns and metamagic\n4 | Guardian Project, focused on creating guard monsters and super soldiers\n5 | Crypsis Project, focused on intelligence and counterintelligence\n6 | Independent research in a new area\n\n\n### Feature: Researcher\n\n\nWhen you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.\n\nYour DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.\n\n\n### Simic Guild Spells\n\n\nPrerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\n\nFor you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\n\nSpell Level | Spells\n--- | ---\nCantrip | acid splash, druidcraft\n1st | detect poison and disease, expeditious retreat, jump\n2nd | alter self, enhance ability, enlarge/reduce\n3rd | gaseous form, water breathing, wind wall\n4th | freedom of movement, polymorph\n5th | creation\n\nWhen your magic causes physical alterations in yourself or others, the result often displays the characteristics of fish, amphibians, or other water-dwelling creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy sometimes accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that reflect the mathematical perfection of nature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe bizarre science of the Simic Combine attracts a certain type of personality and encompasses a set of beliefs about the nature of life. Simic members' bonds and flaws derive from their scientific research—including their creation of new life forms, which they can become very attached to.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I can't wait to see what I become next!\n2 | I am convinced that everything inclines toward constant improvement.\n3 | I'm eager to explain every detail of my most intricate experiments and theories to anyone who shows the least bit of interest.\n4 | I assume that everyone needs even the most basic concepts explained to them.\n5 | I describe everything that happens as if it were going into my research notes (and it often is).\n6 | I am insatiably curious about the seemingly infinite forms and adaptations of life.\n7 | I can't resist prying into anything forbidden, since it must be terribly interesting.\n8 | I employ a highly technical vocabulary to avoid imprecision and ambiguity in my communication.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Change. All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along—no matter what must be upended along the way. (Chaotic)\n3 | Knowledge. Understanding the world is more important than what you do with your knowledge. (Neutral)\n4 | Greater Good. I want to reshape the world into higher forms of life so that all can enjoy evolution. (Good)\n5 | Logic. It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful)\n6 | Superiority. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me.\n2 | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica.\n3 | The other researchers in my clade are my family—a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species.\n4 | The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me.\n5 | I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation.\n6 | Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden.\n2 | I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters.\n3 | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.\n4 | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger.\n5 | I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance.\n6 | I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete.\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n\nThe fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds.\n\nRoll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table.\n\nd8 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | My research builds on my parents' work and takes it in interesting new directions.\n2 | If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought.\n3 | A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project.\n4 | A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal.\n5 | A former lover is now the supervisor of a prominent clade.\n6 | My sibling has become an almost unrecognizable mutant.\n7 | An old friend has retreated into a secluded life as an ascetic deepsage, devoted to contemplating philosophical principles.\n8 | My former clade supervisor is now engaged in field research studying some of the largest beasts and monsters on Ravnica.\n\nd10 | Contact\n--- | ---\n1 | My older sibling is upset that I didn't follow them into the Azorius.\n2 | A Boros sergeant is always asking questions about my work, but I suspect they're genuinely curious.\n3 | A friend in my clade thinks I don't know they're a Dimir agent.\n4 | I helped a Golgari spore druid with the fertilization and growth of their fungus field.\n5 | I can't fathom what could have made my childhood friend run off and join the Gruul.\n6 | I love comparing notes with my friend in the Izzet, though our fields of research are very different.\n7 | I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research.\n8 | A Rakdos ringmaster has taken an interest in my research which, come to think of it, might make a nice sideshow act.\n9 | I left the Selesnya—and a lover—behind when I joined the Simic.\n10 | Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n\n\n### How Do I Fit In?\n\n\nAs a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.\n\nSelf-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable—whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation—gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.",

While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.\n\n\n### Claim to Fame\n\n\nEvery smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character.\n\nd6 | Accomplishment\n--- | ---\n1 | Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile.\n2 | Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants.\n3 | The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation's navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here.\n4 | River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home.\n5 | Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture.\n6 | Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nIn general, smugglers value survival, and then profit, above other things. One could be a part of a larger organization, or might run a small smuggling vessel of their own. Smugglers live the lies they have told, and they have a natural ability to recall all the falsehoods and half-truths they have ever spouted.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I love being on the water but hate fishing.\n2 | I think of everything in terms of monetary value.\n3 | I never stop smiling.\n4 | Nothing rattles me; I have a lie for every occasion.\n5 | I love gold but won't cheat a friend.\n6 | I enjoy doing things others believe to be impossible.\n7 | I become wistful when I see the sun rise over the ocean.\n8 | I am no common criminal; I am a mastermind.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Wealth Heaps of coins in a secure vault is all I dream of. (Any)\n2 | Smuggler's Code I uphold the unwritten rules of the smugglers, who do not cheat one another or directly harm innocents. (Lawful)\n3 | All for a Coin I'll do nearly anything if it means I turn a profit. (Evil)\n4 | Peace and Prosperity I smuggle only to achieve a greater goal that benefits my community. (Good)\n5 | People For all my many lies, I place a high value on friendship. (Any)\n6 | Daring I am most happy when risking everything. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My vessel was stolen from me, and I burn with the desire to recover it.\n2 | I intend to become the leader of the network of smugglers that I belong to.\n3 | I owe a debt that cannot be repaid in gold.\n4 | After one last job, I will retire from the business.\n5 | I was tricked by a fellow smuggler who stole something precious from me. I will find that thief.\n6 | I give most of my profits to a charitable cause, and I don't like to brag about it.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | Lying is reflexive, and I sometimes engage in it without realizing.\n2 | I tend to assess my relationships in terms of profit and loss.\n3 | I believe everyone has a price and am cynical toward those who present themselves as virtuous.\n4 | I struggle to trust the words of others.\n5 | Few people know the real me.\n6 | Though I act charming, I feel nothing for others and don't know what friendship is.",

Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.\n\n\n### Specialty\n\n\nDuring your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:\n\nd8 | Role\n--- | ---\n1 | Officer\n2 | Scout\n3 | Infantry\n4 | Cavalry\n5 | Healer\n6 | Quartermaster\n7 | Standard-bearer\n8 | Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like)\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThe horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm always polite and respectful.\n2 | I'm haunted by memories of war. I can't get the images of violence out of my mind.\n3 | I've lost too many friends, and I'm slow to make new ones.\n4 | I'm full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation.\n5 | I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.\n6 | I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.\n7 | I have a crude sense of humor.\n8 | I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Good)\n2 | Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)\n3 | Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic)\n4 | Might.

To this day, I will never leave a friend behind.\n3 | My honor is my life.\n4 | I'll never forget the crushing defeat my company suffered or the enemies who dealt it.\n5 | Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.\n6 | I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear.\n2 | I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.\n3 | I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives—and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret.\n4 | My hatred of my enemies is blinding and unreasoning.\n5 | I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.\n6 | I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong.",

When everyone was fleeing Phlan, you choose to stay. Whether out of an emotional attachment, or pursuit of riches, you made the decision that would affect the rest of your life.\n\nFood became scarcer for those without connections. You became a beggar and to stay alive you bartered information to any interested party with food or gold to spare. You were good at what you did, and thought you were invincible. That changed when you were captured by the Tears of Virulence, the soldiers of Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence, for selling secrets to those bent on overthrowing the dragon. They locked you in the cells of Stojanow Gate. The first weeks you hoped to stay alive. As the weeks turned into months, and the interrogations continued you began to pray for death.\n\n\n### Feature: Ex-Convict\n\n\nThe knowledge gained during your incarceration lets you gain insight into local guards and jailors. You know which will accept bribes, or look the other way for you. You can also seek shelter for yourself from authorities with other criminals in the area.

The one time I let others plan things it did not end well for me.\n7 | I take blame to protect others from pain.\n8 | I hoard information, you never know what may come in handy.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Loss. I freely give those who offend me what was so brutally denied me, death. (Chaos)\n2 | Dedication. I never betray those who trust me. (Law)\n3 | Vengeance.

You migrated from location to location, living off the land with your tribe. The tribe would seasonally travel south into the Grass Sea and the Giant's Cairn, north into the Dragonspine Mountains, and even occasionally east across the Stojanow River to the borders of the Quivering forest.\n\nIn your migrations, your people have come to know the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant's Cairn. The dragon cultists came to the hills one day—magic-users wearing purple and riding horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.\n\n\n### Feature: At Home in the Wild\n\n\nThe wilderness is your home and you are comfortable dwelling in it. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate when out in the wild. This place of rest is secure enough to conceal you from most natural threats. Threats that are supernatural, magical, or are actively seeking you out might do so with difficulty depending on the nature of the threat (as determined by the DM). However, this feature doesn't shield or conceal you from scrying, mental probing, nor from threats that don't necessarily require the five senses to find you. Note: This feature is a variant of the Folk Hero feature.\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nTicklebelly nomads only venture into civilization when necessary. You are social within your tribe, with tribes of other nomads, and even with the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant's Cairn. However, other communities tend to either put you on your guard or put you in a state of wonder. Was it this wonder that enticed you into a life of adventuring? On the other hand, you are fiercely protective of and dedicated to your tribe. Perhaps it was this dedication that led you to venture out; either of your own will or at the behest of your tribe's leaders.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I eagerly inject myself into the unknown.\n2 | Villages, towns, and cities do not suit me. I'd rather be out in the wilderness any day.\n3 | I accomplish my tasks efficiently, using as few resources as possible.\n4 | It's difficult for me to remain in one place for long.\n5 | I loudly brag about my tribe every chance I get.\n6 | Having walked among giants, I am fearless in the face of bigger creatures.\n7 | I am quiet and reserved, but observant. Nothing escapes my attention.\n8 | My word is my bond. I see a promise to completion, even if it conflicts with my beliefs.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Kinship. Family is most important in life. Though I may be far from my own, the bonds of family must be protected in others' lives as well. (Good)\n2 | Preservation. Nature must not be despoiled by encroaching civilization. (Any)\n3 | Wanderlust. One must expand their horizons by seeing the world and exploring. (Chaos)\n4 | Isolation. My tribe and its ways must be protected and shielded from outside influence. (Neutral)\n5 | Protection. Threats to the land and to the people must be dealt with at any and all costs. (Law)\n6 | Belonging: All creatures have a place in the world, so I strive to help others find theirs. (Good)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I ache to return to my tribe and the family I left, but cannot until my obligations are fulfilled.\n2 | The dragon cultists that invaded my homeland stole away one of my tribe's people. I will not know rest until I've found them.\n3 | The dragon's presence in the hills destroyed valuable territory and resulted in deaths within my tribe. The creature must pay for what it has done.\n4 | I carry a trinket that spiritually and emotionally ties me to my people and my home.\n5 | I discovered a strange relic in the hills during my tribe's wanderings. I must discover what it is.\n6 | One of the stone giant clans from the Giant's Cairn has graced me with a mark of kinship.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I throw myself and my friends into situations rarely ever thinking about consequences.\n2 | Unfamiliar people and surroundings put me on edge.\n3 | I have absolutely no patience for slowpokes and those who prove indecisive.\n4 | My desire to experience new things causes me to make unsafe choices.\n5 | I am overly protective of nature, sometimes to the detriment of my companions and myself.\n6 | My lack of worldliness often proves my undoing in social, commercial, and hostile situations.",

(Kefnet)\n4 | I enjoy teasing acolytes and initiates with juicy tidbits of knowledge wrapped up in fiendishly difficult puzzles. (Kefnet)\n5 | I have the utmost faith in myself and my abilities. (Rhonas)\n6 | I get restless when life in the city feels too tame, too safe. (Rhonas)\n7 | I enjoy solitude as an opportunity to plan my victory. (Bontu)\n8 | I use satire as a way to undermine the teachings of the other gods. (Bontu)\n9 | I love, fight, and feast with equal zeal. (Hazoret)\n10 | I think of those in my care as my family, in a way that most people have trouble understanding. (Hazoret)\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Solidarity. The worthy must respect the worthy. In the afterlife, all will be united in goal and action. (Oketra)\n2 | Knowledge. The worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind, so as to perceive the wonders beyond imagination that wait in the afterlife. (Kefnet)\n3 | Strength. The worthy shall hone a strong body that can withstand the boundless energies of the afterlife. (Rhonas)\n4 | Ambition. The worthy shall strive for greatness, for supremacy in life leads to supremacy in the afterlife. (Bontu)\n5 | Zeal. The worthy shall rush to the God-Pharaoh's side with relentless passion, rising to overcome every obstacle in their way. (Hazoret)\n6 | Naktamun. The life of the city is ordered according to the plan of the God-Pharaoh, and that order must be preserved at all costs.\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | My loyalty to my companions embodies the ideal of loyalty to my god. (Oketra)\n2 | The teachings of my god are more precious to me than any possession. (Kefnet)\n3 | I would do anything to defend the temple of my god from any harm or desecration. (Rhonas)\n4 | I am committed to the service of my god—because it's my sure ticket into the afterlife. (Bontu)\n5 | I love my god and never want my service to end. (Hazoret)\n6 | I have a close friend or lover who is also a vizier.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I am in love with an initiate, and I want to shield this person from death in the trials.\n2 | I secretly wish I had not been chosen as a vizier, so I could participate in the trials as an initiate.\n3 | I secretly question whether the gods care at all about us or what we do.\n4 | A vizier of another god seeks my death in retribution for a past insult.\n5 | I am terrified of what lies beyond the Gate to the Afterlife.\n6 | I secretly believe the God-Pharaoh's return will not bring blessing to this world.",

I will see it through.\n2 | My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything.

Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe.\n\nThis advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income—the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.\n\nUse the tables for the noble background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family.\n\nLike other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know - one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house.",

The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal'Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, Percival de Rolo, manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes.\n\nYou were granted a musket or a pistol by your commander in the Whitestone Rifle Corps. This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM's discretion.\n\n\n### Feature: Rifle Corps Relationship\n\n\nYou are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of Whitestone's staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in Whitestone, you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions.\n\nd6 | Current Relationship\n--- | ---\n1 | I retired honorably from the Rifle Corps—and now it's time for me to pursue my own adventures.\n2 | I'm on an important mission to protect Whitestone or guard one of our allies.\n3 | Whitestone is in trouble, and I was sent away to seek help.\n4 | I don't think firearms technology should be kept secret, so I escaped from the Rifle Corps with my weapon and am on the run.\n5 | I was on a mission with my company when I got separated from them. Now I need to find my way back home.\n6 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original. (Whitestone Hunter variant only)\n\n\n### Suggested Characteristics\n\n\nThose who join the Whitestone Rifle Corps become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state's staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you're not at home protecting Whitestone. Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home.\n\nYour bond is likely associated with your comrades-in-arms or with Whitestone itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues.\n\nd8 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I want to make a good impression at all times. That means keeping my clothes and gear clean and in top condition.\n2 | I don't like being the center of attention. I'd rather let someone else do the talking while I watch their back.\n3 | I feel safe only if I'm carrying my trusty rifle. And my dagger. And my concealed pistol. Oh, and of course my....\n4 | I don't trust people with my secrets easily, so it feels like a big deal when someone else shares a secret with me.\n5 | I like coming up with solutions to problems using my esoteric knowledge of natural philosophy.\n6 | Everyone around me takes things so seriously. Sometimes I just want to let loose and have fun!\n7 | Knowing things that other people don't know makes me feel special and important.\n8 | I'm most at home in woods and mountains, where everything feels at once familiar, always growing and changing.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Responsibility. I have a duty to protect the people of Whitestone and to uphold the trust placed in me by the de Rolos. (Lawful)\n2 | Militarization. Everyone should have access to the most powerful weapons available, so they can defend themselves effectively. (Evil)\n3 | Cooperation. Any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to work together. (Good)\n4 | Camaraderie. It's important to have people you can trust to help out in a fight—and to uncork a bottle together afterward. (Any)\n5 | Context. There are no universal rights or wrongs. Every choice depends on the details of the situation. (Chaotic)\n6 | Secrecy. Information is valuable, but it can also be dangerous. I'll keep my mouth shut and gather as much intel as I can. (Neutral)\n\nd6 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I never knew what to do with myself until I joined the Rifle Corps. Now I have a purpose and comrades to give me direction.\n2 | One of my fellow Rifle Corps soldiers saved my life—and then I saved theirs. That kind of bond lasts forever.\n3 | Whitestone is the best city in all of Tal'Dorei. Nowhere else has been blessed by the The Dawnfather and has a clock that tracks the movement of the stars!\n4 | My quick thinking saved a noble from assassination, and she showed me great kindness in return. I daren't say it, but I'm more loyal to her than I am to the de Rolos.\n5 | My weapon is my life. I clean it, repair it, and care for it—and it serves me loyally in return.\n6 | The people of Whitestone cared for my family when we had nothing. I promise to repay their compassion with my service.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | Who cares about keeping this gun safe? \"Don't let it fall into the wrong hands!\" Ha! It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and these weapons are everywhere.\n2 | I think being part of the Rifle Corps is so cool. I love telling people about my position so I can impress them.\n3 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original.\n4 | I'm tired of protecting spoiled people who don't know how to protect themselves.\n5 | I shoot first and ask questions later.\n6 | The first and only time I killed someone, it changed my life. I still dream about it, and I'll never be the carefree person I was before.",

In addition, you may wander about the carnival and partake of its many wonders at no cost to you, provided you don't disrupt its shows or cause any other trouble.\n\n\n### Carnival Companion\n\n\nOver the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you've befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you're in the carnival, but it won't voluntarily leave the carnival.\n\nThe DM can use the Witchlight Hand (Medium) stat block in chapter 1 to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the Monster Manual.\n\nd8 | Companion\n--- | ---\n1 | Old, cantankerous Witchlight hand\n2 | Young, impressionable Witchlight hand\n3 | Performer (such as an acrobat, a clown, or a musician)\n4 | Retired performer\n5 | Seasoned animal trainer\n6 | Old blink dog\n7 | Cheery sprite\n8 | Harmless, magical wisp of light (no stat block required) that has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet\n\nAs the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the Player's Handbook, or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.\n\nThese tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.\n\nd8 | Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I'm haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me.\n2 | Like a nomad, I can't settle down in one place for very long.\n3 | Good music makes me weep like a baby.\n4 | Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.\n5 | I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.\n6 | When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.\n7 | I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.\n8 | I can't bring myself to trust most adults.\n\nd8 | Ideal\n--- | ---\n1 | Friendship. I never leave a friend behind. (Good)\n2 | Empathy. No creature should be made to suffer. (Good)\n3 | Wanderlust. I prefer to take the less traveled path. (Chaotic)\n4 | Changeability. Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic)\n5 | Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful)\n6 | Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the \"rule of three\" everywhere. (Lawful)\n7 | Obsession. I won't let go of a grudge. (Evil)\n8 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause. (Evil)\n\nd8 | Bond\n--- | ---\n1 | I would never break my word.\n2 | I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it.\n3 | I do what I can to protect the natural world.\n4 | A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me.\n5 | I can't bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions.\n6 | The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me.\n7 | I'm drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while.\n8 | I feel indebted to Mister Witch and Mister Light for giving me a home and a purpose.\n\nd8 | Flaw\n--- | ---\n1 | I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I'm always late.\n2 | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.\n3 | I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule.\n4 | I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure.\n5 | I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things.\n6 | I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.\n7 | I have many vices and tend to indulge them.\n8 | I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always.",

The Witherbloom Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.\n\nd6 | Personality Trait\n--- | ---\n1 | I love brewing up a new recipe, even if some might be repulsed by my choice of ingredients. Or the final product. Or both.\n2 | My fashion sense is like my garden: withered, black, and weird.\n3 | I'm going to befriend every single monster in this swamp if it's the last thing I do.\n4 | Everything in this world dies eventually.
