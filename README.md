hi, this is the readME to set up the frontend of ScribeMaster

Before this, you should have first set up the backend using XKMai's instructions

check that the api link address is correct in axiosConfig.ts

clone the repo, and cd into the project directory if you aren't inside already, with

cd ./scribemaster/

then, install all dependencies with 

npm install

finally, run it with 

npm run dev

and follow the link given

if you get a cors origin error, then copypaste the links in the frontend to be used backend's main.ts file
